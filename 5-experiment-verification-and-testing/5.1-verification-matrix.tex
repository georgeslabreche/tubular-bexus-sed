\subsection{Verification Matrix}

The verification matrix was made following the standard of \textit{ECSS-E-10-02A}. \cite{ECSSSecretariat}. This section does not list obsolete requirements. For a complete list of requirements that include obsolete ones, refer to Appendix \ref{sec:appFullListOfRequirements}.

\textit{There are four established verification methods:}
\newline \textit{A - Verification by analysis or similarity}
\newline \textit{I - Verification by inspection}
\newline \textit{R - Verification by review-of-design}
%\newline \textit{S - Verification by similarity}
\newline \textit{T - Verification by testing}
