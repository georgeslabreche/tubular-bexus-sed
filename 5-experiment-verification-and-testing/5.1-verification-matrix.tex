\subsection{Verification Matrix}

The verification matrix is made following the standard of \textit{ECSS-E-10-02A}. \cite{ECSSSecretariat}

\textit{There are four established verification methods:}
\newline \textit{A - Verification by analysis or similarity}
\newline \textit{I - Verification by inspection}
\newline \textit{R - Verification by review-of-design}
%\newline \textit{S - Verification by similarity}
\newline \textit{T - Verification by testing}

Currently, no verification has yet transpired due to the hardware and software components potentially fitting the requirements still being sought and ordered and/or requested. As the project advances and the parts for each division arrive or are developed, the verification methods will be revised, and test numbers and status will be assigned.
