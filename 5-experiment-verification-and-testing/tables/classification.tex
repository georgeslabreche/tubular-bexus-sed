\hline
\textbf{Priority Level} & \textbf{Test Number} & \textbf{Classification} \\ \hline
High & 4, 5, 7, 10, 17 & \begin{itemize}
    \item Requires the use of external facilities which must be booked in advance and could have limited availability.
    \item If a re-test is required the wait time could be on the order of weeks or months.
    \item Testing could potentially break a non-spare component with a long re-order time.
\end{itemize}\\ \hline
Medium & 2, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 27, 29, 30 & \begin{itemize}
    \item Requires internal cooperation or multiple parts of the experiment completed to a minimum standard.
    \item If a re-test is required the wait time could be on the order of days.
    \item Testing could potentially break a critical component that would require re-ordering or replacing.
\end{itemize} \\ \hline
Low & 3, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 25, 28, 31, 32 & \begin{itemize}
    \item Can be performed by a single department.
    \item If a re-test is required the wait time could be on the order of hours.
    \item Have low or no risk of breaking components.
