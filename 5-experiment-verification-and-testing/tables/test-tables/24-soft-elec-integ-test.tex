\multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Test Level/ Procedure \\ and Duration\end{tabular}}} & Test procedure: Once the electronics is at minimum in a breadboard state it will be tested with the software. This will begin with sensor checks. The Arduino will be connected to the sensors and performance checked. Once the switching circuits have been completed for the valves, pump, and heaters the software which controls how these components turn on and off will be tested. If any of the responses from the electronics are not what was expected from the input from the software then the electronic connections will be checked and the software refined and the test will repeat. These tests will begin on bread board electronics and continue as the electronics are fixed into their final positions. In addition as the software will continue to be developed until 15th September these tests will repeat to ensure that performance continues to be as expected. \\ & Test duration: Recurrent \\ \hline
