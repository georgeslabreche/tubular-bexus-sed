\multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Test Level/ Procedure \\ and Duration\footnote[12]{All test procedure and duration's are subject to change. \label{fn:testing}}\end{tabular}}} & Test procedure: Once the sampling system has been connected, including the bags, lay or hang the system out on the bench. The valves will be opened and closed in series and the pump switched on and off using the Arduino to control them. The Arduino should be supplied simulated pressure sensor readings so that the system will run the sampling points as it would during flight. The bags will be monitored to check that they are inflating as expected. Airflow and static pressure readings that give the pressure from inside the bags will be used to verify that sampling is occurring properly. \\ & Test duration: 3 hours. \\ \hline
