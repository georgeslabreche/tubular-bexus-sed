\multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Test Level/ Procedure \\ and Duration\textsuperscript{\ref{fn:testing}}\end{tabular}}} & Test procedure: Take sampling system down to 20hPa and verify all systems work. If the size of the vacuum chamber is restrictive testing just the pump with the airflow and pressure sensors, one valve and one bag will suffice. Ensure valves and pump still perform as expected by checking the flow rate with the airflow sensor and visually observing the bag inflating. In addition the insulating foam will be check to ensure it does not deform when exposed to low pressures.\\ & Test duration: 5 hours \\ \hline
