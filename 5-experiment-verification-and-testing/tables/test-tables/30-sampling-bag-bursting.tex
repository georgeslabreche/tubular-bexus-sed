If the tested sampling bag does not burst after 3 minutes of continuous pumping, remove the sampling bag from the pressure chamber and leave at rest to check if it will burst within 48 hours. If bursting occurs in the chamber while the sampling bag is being pump then observe and characterize its impact to assess whether a similar bursting risks damaging the sampling bag's surrounding in the experimental setup. If the bursting occurs during the 48 hours rest period then observe and characterize the damage/rupture on the sampling bag to assess whether a similar bursting risks damaging the sampling bag's surrounding in the experimental setup. \\ & Test duration: 3 minutes to 48 hours. \\ \hline
