\subsection{Schedule}

Scheduling of the project is presented in a Gantt Chart overview on Figure \ref{fig:schedule-gantt-chart}. Exam period constraints were included in order to evaluate risks in person-day allocations to project implementation. It was expected during exam periods the team work output would be lower than usual but project activities did continue, with time planned accordingly to accommodate this:

An expanded version of the Gantt Chart with detailed listing of all sub-tasks not shown in Figure \ref{fig:schedule-gantt-chart} can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:appF}. This expanded Gantt Chart includes all tasks related to the test plan and internal deadlines were set so that a first draft of the documentation was completed one week in advance to allow contents to be checked. Build and test internal deadlines were also placed one week in advance to allow a buffer in case things did not go as expected. The tests were scheduled for as early as possible to allow time for rescheduling if the result was a fail. With some high priority tests, see Section \ref{sec:5.2.1-testpriority}, it was expected these would be very difficult to reschedule therefore extra time was built into the test duration to allow for multiple attempts at the test.
