\subsection{Risk Register}
\textbf{Risk ID}
\begin{enumerate}[label={}]
    \item TC – Technical/Implementation 
    \item MS – Mission (operational performance) 
    \item SF – Safety 
    \item VE – Vehicle 
    \item PE – Personnel 
    \item EN – Environmental 
    \item OR - Outreach
    \item BG - Budget
\end{enumerate}

Adapt these to the experiment and add other categories. 
Consider risks to the experiment, to the vehicle and to personnel. 

\textbf{Probability (P)}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*]
    \item Minimum – Almost impossible to occur 
    \item Low – Small chance to occur 
    \item Medium – Reasonable chance to occur 
    \item High – Quite likely to occur 
    \item Maximum – Certain to occur, maybe more than once
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Severity (S)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Negligible – Minimal or no impact 
    \item Significant – Leads to reduced experiment performance 
    \item Major – Leads to failure of subsystem or loss of flight data 
    \item Critical – Leads to experiment failure or creates minor health hazards 
    \item Catastrophic – Leads to termination of the REXUS/BEXUS programme, damage to the vehicle or injury to personnel 
\end{enumerate}

The rankings for probability (P) and severity (S) are combined to assess the overall risk classification, ranging from very low to very high and being coloured green, yellow, orange or red according to the SED guidelines.

Whether a risk is acceptable or unacceptable has been assigned according to the SED guidelines. Where mitigation is written for acceptable risks this details the mitigation undertaken in order to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.
