EN20 & The air samples must be protected from direct sunlight and stored above 0 \degree C to prevent condensation & C & 3 & \cellcolor[HTML]{FCFF2F}Low & Acceptable Risk: Stratospheric air is generally dry and water vapor concentrations are higher closer to the surface. In addition magnesium perchlorate dryers will be used to minimizing the risk of condensation.    \\ \hline 
PE10 & Change in Project Manager after the CDR introduces a gap of knowledge in management responsibilities. & E & 1 & \cellcolor[HTML]{FCFF2F}Low & Acceptable Risk: A Deputy Project Manager is selected at an early stage and is progressively handed over project management tasks and responsibilities until complete handover after the CDR. The previous Project Manager remotely assists the new Project Manager until the end of the project. The Deputy Project Manager is also part of the Electrical Division so a new team member has been included to that division in order compensate for the Deputy Project Manager's reduced bandwidth to work on Electrical Division tasks once she is appointed Project Manager.\\ \hline
