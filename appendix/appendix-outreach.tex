\subsection{Outreach on Project Website}

To increase the projects out reach the TUBULAR Team created a project website. On the website there are descriptions of the project, a link to download the latest SED, information on the TUBULAR Team members and sponsors and a contact link. In addition the microblogging carried out by the TUBULAR Team is also displayed on the website.

\subsection{Outreach with Open Source Code Hosted on a REXUS/BEXUS GitHub Repository}

The TUBULAR Team has opened a GitHub Repository to share all the code used in the TUBULAR project. It was created with an open invite to all other REXUS/BEXUS teams to view, use and contribute to.

\subsection{Outreach with Team Patch}

The team also had patches made of the TUBULAR logo and 150 patches have been ordered. Around 70 of these have already been bought by the team for themselves and to give to friends and family. It is intended that the remaining 80 will be sold for a small profit at university.

\subsection{Visit by the Canadian Ambassador}
During Canadian Ambassador Heather Grant's visit at the Swedish Institute of Space Physics, the team got the honor to do a brief presentation of the TUBULAR project. It also included a short explanation regarding one of the electrical tests in the vacuum chamber. This is now displayed on the universities website with a link to the TUBULAR website.

\subsection{Attendance at Lift Off 2018}
