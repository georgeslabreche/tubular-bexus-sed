\section{Checklists}\label{sec:Checklist}

%\begin{landscape}

The Pre-Launch Checklist will be taken care of by two team members. One of them will be responsible of reading out loud each item and marking them when they are done. The other one will be responsible for performing the stated actions. At the same time, the one reading will check that the actions are properly conducted. 

For three key actions (M5, M9 and M13), a third team member will be responsible of asking and, when possible, checking, that they have been properly conducted.

\subsection{Recovery Team Checklist}\label{ssec:RecoveryCheck}

FAST RECOVERY OF CAC

\begin{itemize}
    \item Check no damage exists to outer structure and no white paste seen in inlet tubes, this confirms no leak and chemicals are SAFE.
    \item Screw on the three metal plugs provided to the inlet and outlet tubes.
    \item Unplug the gondola power cord from the AAC box. Circled with RED paint. See Figure \ref{fig:Interfaces_Detail_I}.
    \item Unplug the E-Link connection from the AAC box. Circled with RED paint. See Figure \ref{fig:Interfaces_Detail_I}.
    \item Unplug the D-Sub connector from the CAC Box. Circled with RED paint. See Figure \ref{fig:Interfaces_Detail_I}.
    \item Unscrew 6 screws vertically aligned in the CAC frame in the outside face of the experiment. Painted in RED. Allen key \#3. See Figure \ref{fig:Interfaces_Detail_II}.
    \item Unscrew 6 screws vertically aligned in the CAC frame in the inside face of the experiment (opposite to outside). Painted in RED. Allen key \#3.
    \item Unscrew 2 gondola attachment points from the CAC, L-shape anchor, 4 screws in total. Allen key \#3. See Figure \ref{fig:Interfaces_Detail_III}.
    \item Loosen the gondola's safety wire (on the CAC side), use a thick Allen key (i.e.  Allen key \#5) and a clamp.
    \item Remove the CAC Box from the gondola from the lateral side. Handles located at the top of the box. First lift it up, then drag it out. Take care with the outlet tube not to hit the gondola structure.
    \item Tighten the gondola's safety wire (on the CAC side), use a thick Allen key (i.e.  Allen key \#5) and a clamp.
\end{itemize}

REGULAR RECOVERY OF AAC

\begin{itemize}
    \item Unscrew 8 gondola attachment points from the AAC.
    \item Remove the AAC Box from the gondola. Handles located at the top of the box. 
\end{itemize}

If the recovery is not nominal the following instructions should be followed. It should be noted that the chemical on-board, magnesium perchlorate, has the appearance of white powdery stones when dry and a white paste when wet.

\begin{itemize}
    \item If outer structure is damaged or white paste is seen in inlet tubes put on provided gloves before proceeding. Assume possibility chemicals are UNSAFE.
    \item If white paste is seen wipe with provided cloth and seal the end of tube with the provided plugs. Put any contaminated items into a bag which is then sealed.
    \item In event magnesium perchlorate comes into contact with skin wash immediately with water (following the MSDS procedure).
    \item In the event magnesium perchlorate comes into contact with clothes remove clothes as soon as possible and wash before wearing again.
    \item Even if no contact was made with the magnesium perchlorate it is recommended to wash hands after as a preventative measure.
    \item In the event that magnesium perchlorate is seen on the ground or inside the gondola, the appearance is a white paste or white stone, it should be recovered with gloves and wiped and placed into a sealed bag.
\end{itemize}
