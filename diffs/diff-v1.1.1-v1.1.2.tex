The first two things I had to also do were to scale and to reenable my outer page design (to show page numbers again) which can both be set using the configuration, e.g.: \includepdf[pages=-,scale=.8,pagecommand={}]{file}

Carbon dioxide (CO$_{2}$), methane (CH$_{4}$), and nitrous oxide (N$_2$O) are three main greenhouse gases emitted by human activities. Developing a better understanding of their contribution to greenhouse effects requires more accessible, flexible, and scalable air sampling mechanisms. A balloon flight is the most cost-effective mechanism to obtain a vertical air profile through continuous sampling between the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere. However, recovery time constraints due to gas mixture concerns geographically restrict the sampling near existing research centers where analysis of the recovered samples can take place. The TUBULAR experiment is a technology demonstrator for atmospheric research supporting an air sampling mechanism that would offer climate change researchers access to remote areas by minimizing the effect of gas mixtures within the collected samples so that recovery time is no longer a constraint. The experiment will include a secondary sampling mechanism that will serve as reference against which the proposed sampling mechanism can be validated.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{PREFACE}

The Rocket and Balloon Experiments for University Students (REXUS/BEXUS) program is realized under a bilateral Agency Agreement between the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the Swedish National Space Board (SNSB). The Swedish share of the
payload has been made available to students from other European countries through a collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA).

EuroLaunch, a cooperation between the Esrange Space Center of SSC and the Mobile Rocket Base (MORABA) of DLR, is responsible for the campaign management and operations of the launch vehicles. Experts from DLR, SSC, ZARM, and ESA provide
technical support to the student teams throughout the project.

The Student Experiment Documentation (SED) is a continuously updating document regarding the BEXUS student experiment TUBULAR - Alternative AirCore for Atmospheric Greenhouse Gas Sampling (TUBULAR) and will undergo reviews during the preliminary design review, the critical design review, the integration progress review, and final experiment report.

The TUBULAR Team consists of a diverse and inter-disciplinary group of students from Lule√• University of Technology's Masters programme in Atmospheric Studies, Space Engineering, and Spacecraft Design. The idea for the proposed experiment stems from two concerns over the realities of climate change as a result of human activity coupled with the complexity and limitations in obtaining greenhouse gas profile data to support climate change research.

Based above the Arctic circle in Kiruna, Sweden, the TUBULAR Team is exposed to Arctic science research with which it will interact with in order to produce a research detailing the air sampling methodology, measurements, analysis, and findings.

\subsection*{File Naming}
The naming convention for the SED is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item BX for BEXUS or RX for REXUS, plus number of flight
  \item Experiment name
  \item SED, plus version (e.g. 3 for CDR) and issue number (beginning with 0 and increasing number when a new issue is sent)
  \item Date of issue in format ddmmmyy
\end{itemize}

% MAIN TEXT DOCUMENT 
\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Scientific Background}

The ongoing and increasingly rapid melting of the Arctic ice cap has served as a reference to the global climate change. Researchers have noted that \enquote{the Arctic is warming about twice as fast as the rest of the world} \cite{Perkins} and projecting an ice-free Arctic Ocean as a realistic scenario in future summers similar to the Pliocene Epoch when \enquote{global temperature was only 2‚Äì3¬∞C warmer than today} \cite{Trace}. Suggestions that additional loss of Arctic sea ice can be avoided by reducing air pollutant and CO$_{2}$ growth still require confirmation through better climate effect measurements of CO$_{2}$ and non-CO$_{2}$ forcings \cite{Trace}. Such measurements bear high costs, particularly in air sampling for trace gas concentrations in the region between the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere which have a significant effect on the Earth's climate. There is little information on distribution of trace gases at the stratosphere due to the inherent difficulty of measuring gases above aircraft altitudes.

Trace gases, are gases which makes up less than 1\% by volume of the Earth's atmosphere. They include all gasses except Nitrogen, and Oxygen. In terms of climate change, the main concern of the scientific community, focuses on CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ which make up less than 0.1\% of the 1\%, and are referred to as Greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gas concentrations are measured in parts per million (ppm), and parts per billion (ppb). They are the main offenders of the greenhouse effect, released by human activity as they trap heat into the atmosphere. Larger emissions of greenhouse gases lead to higher concentrations of those gases in the atmosphere thus contributing to climate change.

\subsection{Mission Statement}

There is little information on distribution of trace gases at the stratosphere due to the inherent difficulty and high cost of air sampling above aircraft altitudes \cite{Trace}. The experiment seeks to contribute to and support climate change research by proposing and validating a low-cost air sampling mechanism that reduces the current complexities and limitations of obtaining data on stratospheric greenhouse gas distribution.
\pagebreak
\subsection{Experiment Objectives}

Beyond providing knowledge on greenhouse gas distributions, the sampling obtained from the experiment will serve as a reference to validate the robustness and reliability of proposed sampling system through comparative analysis of results obtained with a reference sampling system.

The primary objective of the experiment consists of validating the proposed sampling system as a reliable mechanism that enables sampling of stratospheric greenhouse gases in remote areas.

The secondary objective of the experiment will be to analyze the samples by both systems in a manner that will contribute to climate change research in the Arctic region. The trace gas profiles to be analyzed are that of carbon dioxide (CO$_{2}$), methane (CH$_{4}$), and nitrous oxide (N$_{2}$O). 
\subsection{Experiment Concept}

The experiment seeks to test the viability and reliability of a proposed cost-effective alternative to the The AirCore Sampling System. The AirCore Sampling System consists of a long and thin stainless steel tube shaped in the form of a coil which takes advantage of changes in pressure during descent to sample the surrounding atmosphere and preserve a profile (see Figure \ref{fig:A1} in Appendix A). Sampling during a balloon‚Äôs descent phase will result in a profile shape extending the knowledge of distribution of trace gases for the measured column between the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere \cite{Karion}. The proposed experiment will consist of two sampling subsystems: a conventional implementation of AirCore as described above, henceforth referred to as CAC, and a proposed alternative, henceforth referred to as Alternative AirCore (AAC).

The proposed AAC system is primarily motivated by the CAC sampling mechanism lacking flexibility in choice of coverage area due to the geographical restriction imposed by the irreversible process of gas mixing along the air column sampled in its stainless tube. Because of this, the sampling region for the CAC system needs to remain within proximity to research facilities for post-flight gas analysis. The AAC sampling system is a proposed alternative configuration to the CAC sampling system that has been designed to address this limitation all while improving cost-effectiveness. The AAC sampling system consists of a series of small independent air sampling bags (see Figure \ref{fig:A2} in Appendix A) rather than a single long tube as for the CAC. The air sampling bags will be opened and closed in series to ensure continuous sampling in which analysis can then be merged into a single profile. Each sampling bag is to be allocated a small vertical sampling size of 500 meters in which mixing of gases becomes a lesser concern.

The use of sampling bags in series rather than a single long tube is meant to tackle limitations of CAC by 1) reducing system implementation cost inherent to the production of a long tube and 2) enabling sampling of remote areas by reducing the effect of mixing of gases in post-analysis. Overall design of AAC will be approached with miniaturization, cost-effectiveness, and design for manufacturability (DFM) in mind with the purpose of enabling ease of replication.

\section{Project Planning}
\subsection{Work Breakdown Structure}

The team is categorized into different groups of responsibilities with dedicated leaders who will report to and coordinate with the project manager. Leadership may be organized on a rotational basis should the need arise. The formation of these subteams constitute a work breakdown team structure in which a simplified version is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:work-breakdown-structure}:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{align*}
        \includegraphics[width=16cm]{3-project-planning/img/work-breakdown-structure.png}
    \end{align*}
    \caption{Work Breakdown Structure}\label{fig:work-breakdown-structure}
\end{figure}

The interaction between the subteams will be refined over the course of project implementation to acknowledge the interdisciplinary nature of the experiment around a Payload / Platform scheme.

The Management is composed of a Project Manager acting as the Systems Engineer and managing overall implementation of the project. The Project Manager is responsible for establishing and overseeing product development cycle; coordinating between different teams, project stakeholders, and documentation efforts; outreach and public relations; Fundraising; monitoring and reporting; system integration; and quality assurance.

The Scientific Division is responsible for defining experiment parameters; data analysis; interpreting and documenting measurements; researching previous AirCore experiments for comparative analysis purposes; evaluating the reliability of the proposed AAC sampling system; conducting measurements of collected samples; documenting and publishing findings; defining experiment parameters; contacting researchers or institutions working on similar projects; exploring potential partnership with researchers and institutions; documenting and publishing findings.

The Mechanical Division is responsible for designing or redesigning cost-effective mechanical devices using analysis and computer-aided design; producing details of specifications and outline designs; overseeing the manufacturing process for the devices; identifying material and component suppliers; developing and testing prototypes of designed devices; analyzing test results and changing the design as needed; and integrating and assembling final design.

The Electrical Division is responsible for designing and implementing cost-effective circuitry using analysis and computer-aided design; producing details of specifications and outline designs; developing, testing, and evaluating theoretical designs; identifying material as well as component suppliers; reviewing and testing proposed designs; recommending modifications following prototype test results; and assembling designed circuitry.

The Software Division is responsible for gathering software requirements; formalizing software specifications; drafting architecture design; leading software implementation efforts; leading quality assurance and testing efforts; enforcing software testing best practices such as continuous integration testing and regression testing; reviewing requirements and specifications in order to foresee potential issues; providing input for functional requirements; advising on design; formalizing test cases; tracking defects and ensuring their resolution; facilitating code review sessions; and supporting software implementation efforts.

\subsection{Schedule}

Scheduling of the project is presented in a Gantt Chart overview on Figure \ref{fig:schedule-gantt-chart}. Exam period constraints have been included in order to evaluate risks in person-day allocations to project implementation:

All TUBULAR team members are based in Kiruna, Sweden, just 40 kilometers from Esrange Space Center. Furthermore, all team members are enrolled in LTU Master programmes in Kiruna and thus expected to remain in Kiruna during the entire project period. Special attention will have to be made for planning during the summer period where many team members are expected to travel abroad. An initial timeline of team member availability  until January 2019 is available in Appendix \ref{sec:appD}. A significant risk can be observed during the summer months from June to August where most members will only be partially and some completely unavailable. Team member availability and work commitments over the summer still need to be negotiated and finalized across team members in order to reduce incurred risks to the project. Furthermore, the Project Manager role will have to be assigned to another team member due to extended unavailability and partial availability.

As part of their respective Master programmes, all TUBULAR team members are enrolled in a project course at LTU. The TUBULAR project acts as the course's project for all team members from which they will obtain ECTS credits. This course is supervised by Dr. Thomas Kuhn, Associate Professor at LTU.

\pagebreak
\subsubsection{Budget}
LTU will provide financial assistance for part of the hardware expenses, approximately 250 EUR per team member\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, with possibility for ECTS credits}\DIFdelend . This brings the total budget to 2 500 EUR thus far. However, the total cost of the project is 8 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{295.04 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{376.65 }\DIFaddend EUR\footnote{The cost of some items have been estimated due to lack of direct quotes from vendors. A total error margin of 5\% has been included in the final budget to account for possible estimation errors.}. In order to fill this budget gap, the following potential sources of funding are to be explored throughout the first stages of the project implementation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Swedish National Space Board, SNSB, will be reached out to during their next open call to researchers in Sweden to apply for funding for Space Research, including Earth Observation Research.
    \item The Swedish Research Council typically opens calls for \enquote{Proof of Concept Grant ‚Äì Life science} as well as \enquote{Natural and Engineering Sciences} research grants to which an application will be sent to during the upcoming 2018 calls.
    \item Meteorological institutes, research initiatives, researchers, academic institutions, and institutional donors involved in climate change will be reached out to for contributions based on the interest of collaborating in the experiment.
    \item Third-party providers of required equipment, components, and materials will be approached with an opportunity for these providers to sponsor the project through donation before considering the related expenses. Visibility of the experiment through the planned outreach programs will serve as a visibility incentive to encourage such contributions.
    \item A small online crowdfunding campaign will be organized that will primarily target contributions from the team members' first and second degree contacts.
\end{itemize}

The project budget is detailed in Table \ref{tab:budget-table}. The budget table does not include costs related to component redundancy and as such consist of the minimum cost to build the experiment. Not included in the total are components supplied by partners and potential sponsors (e.g. the CAC tube supplied by FMI). Funding from LTU covers \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{30.01}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{28}\DIFaddend \% of the total costs while it is projected that a SNSB grant will cover \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{33.54}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{31}\DIFaddend \%. The remaining costs are associated with the air sampling bags for which sponsorship will actively be sought from a manufacturer \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(at the time of writing, discussions with the manufacturer Restek Corporation are ongoing regarding sponsorship of air sampling bags)}\DIFaddend .

\subsubsection{External Support}

Partnership with the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI), and the Swedish Institute of Space Physics (IRF) will provide the team with technical guidance in implementing the sampling system. FMI‚Äôs experience in implementing past AirCore sample systems provide invaluable lessons learned towards conceptualizing, designing, and implementing the proposed AAC sampling system.

FMI is a key partner in the TUBULAR project, its scientific experts will advise and support the TUBULAR project by sharing knowledge, experience, and granting accessibility of equipment. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{As per the agreement shown in Appendix \ref{sec:appG}, }\DIFaddend FMI will provide the TUBULAR team with the AirCore stainless tube component of CAC subsystem as well as the post-flight gas analyzer. This arrangement requires careful considerations on the placement of the experiment in order to minimize hardware damage risks. These contributions will result in significant cost savings regarding equipment and component procurement.

Daily access to LTU's Space Campus in Kiruna will expose the team to scientific mentorship and expert guidance from both professors and researchers involved in the study of greenhouse gases and climate change. Dr Uwe Raffalski, Swedish institute of Space physics (IRF), Associate professor (Docent) is one of many researchers involved in climate study who is mentoring the team.

\subsection{Outreach Approach}

The experiment as well as the BEXUS programme and its partners will be promoted through the following activities:

\begin{itemize}
\item Research paper published in partnership with the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) detailing the sampling methodology, measurement result, analysis, and findings.
\item Collected data will be licensed as open data to be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control.
\item A website will be launched that will summarize the experiment and provide regular updates. Backend web analytics included to gauge interest on the project through number of visitors and their origins.
\item Dedicated Facebook page used as publicly accessible logbook detailing challenges, progress, and status of the project. Open for comments and questions (See Figure \ref{fig:outreach-facebook} in Appendix \ref{sec:appE}).
\item Two Instagram accounts for short and frequent image and video focused updates. A primary Instagram account will be dedicated to project updates. A secondary account will reach out to a broader audience by focusing on space instruments in general and cross-reference TUBULAR related activities when relevant (See Figures \ref{fig:outreach-instagram}, \ref{fig:outreach-instagram-si-1}, and \ref{fig:outreach-instagram-si-2} in Appendix \ref{sec:appE}).
\item GitHub account to host all project software code under free and open source license (See Figures \ref{fig:outreach-github} in Appendix \ref{sec:appE}). Other REXUS/BEXUS teams will be invited to host their code in this account in what will hopefully become a centralized GitHub account and code archive for present and future REXUS/BEXUS projects.
\item Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) thread to discuss the project with community of online enthusiasts.
\item\enquote{Show and Tell} trips to local high schools and universities. Team members will be responsible to organize such presentations through any of their travel opportunities abroad.
\item In-booth presentation and poster display in the seminars or career events at different universities. 
\item A thoroughly documented and user-friendly manual on how to build replicate and launch CAC and AAC sampling systems will be produced and published.

\section{Experiment Design}
\subsection{Experiment Setup} \label{Experiment_Setup}

The experiment consists of AAC ten sampling bags subsystem, and the CAC coiled tube subsystem. The principal aim is to validate the AAC sampling method and to do so, it is necessary to sample during descent phase in order to compare the results with the ones obtained from the CAC. All speeds mentioned in this section have been obtained from the BEXUS manual as well as through analysis of past flights.

The primary concern regarding the AAC air sampling subsystem is that after cut-off the gondola will tumble and fall at an average speed of 50 m/s for approximately 2 minutes \cite{BexusManual}. This falling speed is too fast in order to sample air at the desired vertical resolution that is targeted to be 500m. This means that only after the gondola is stabilized at a descent rate of 8 m/s \cite{BexusManual} the sampling can be done. The tumbling phase will span approximately for 6km and considering a floating phase at 25km, the sampling can be started from 19km in altitude. Nevertheless, the main region of interest is the stratosphere, especially between 19km and 25km of altitude. It is for this reason that the team has decided to sample during ascent phase as well. Ten sampling bags will be filled up, six during ascent phase approximately between 18-24km, and four during descent phase below 19km. The desired vertical resolution is 500 m at a falling speed of 8 m/s which means that using bags with a volume of 3L, an air pump with at least 3L/min intake rate is necessary for the sampling bags.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{It has to be taken into account the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend maximum pressure that the sampling bags can withstand \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{has to be taken into account }\DIFaddend in order to avoid bursting. During ascent phase, due to the decreasing pressure, the bags with the air samples , will expand which may have risk of bursting. To avoid this, the bags should not be fully sampled. The providers recommend not to fill more than 80 percent (~2psi/0.14bar) for Multi-Layer Foil bags. The opposite applies for descent phase. The bags with the air samples, will be compressed, and in order to assure that the samples are enough for analysis, they should be fully filled. It has to be mentioned that it has been found from past research \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{LISA} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend that the same bags can withstand a difference in pressure between outside and inside of 310hPa at 30km of altitude, which is equivalent to 0.31bar. Therefore, future test will confirm the maximum pressure for the bags.

Depending on the altitude of sampling, the range of the sample size is between 0.2L and 0.8L, with 0.2L being the minimum amount required for the chromatographer to analyse. 

The AAC will need an air pump for sampling, due to low ambient pressure at stratospheric altitudes. The air pump is also needed in order to assure the intake flow rate and obtain a good resolution. A control valve will be used to flush the pump after each bag is filled and make sure that the next bag will be filled with fresh air from the corresponding altitude. Each sampling bag will be assigned a 500 meter altitude sampling range from which to collect air samples. At an ascent speed of 5 m/s during the Ascent Phase and at a descent speed of 8 m/s during the Descent Phase. 

Shortly after the launch, the CAC valve will be opened in order to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{flush }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{allow flushing }\DIFaddend the inert gas that is inside the tube, while the AAC valves will be closed until reaching the sampling altitude. Flushing of the CAC tube \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be done }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{happens }\DIFaddend passively through the progressive decrease in air pressure during the balloon's ascent phase. The CAC valve will remain open at all time during ascent, floating, and descent phases. The tube will empty itself due to pressure gradient during the ascent phase and it will be filled passively during descent. The valve will close just after hitting the ground in order to preserve the sample. The AAC will need an air pump for sampling, due to low ambient pressure. The air pump is also needed in order to assure the intake flow rate and obtain a good resolution.

After sampling for a given bag is complete, the pump will be flushed and prior to the subsequent sampling bag valve being opened. This process continues until the last sampling bag is filled.This procedure occurs twice, the first time during the Ascent Phase for the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{10 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{6 }\DIFaddend first sampling bags and the second time during the descent phase for the remaining \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{6 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{4 }\DIFaddend sampling bags.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Three pressure sensors and two temperature sensors will be used. The data will be collected for both systems }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The ambient pressure will be measured by three pressure sensors located inside the experiment box. Only one of them is necessary for }\DIFaddend AAC and CAC\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. Temperature inside the bags or the AirCore will not be measured directly because it }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, but three sensors will be used for redundancy reasons. The pressure inside the AirCore }\DIFaddend is assumed to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{quickly adjust to the ambient temperature. Therefore only two sensors measuring ambient temperature will be necessary (one for CAC and another for AAC). The ambient pressure will be measured with two more sensors, one }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{be the same as the ambient pressure, therefore no sensor is needed. To measure the pressure inside the bags, three more sensors will be allocated inside the valve center. To measure ambient temperature in the AirCore, three sensors will be allocated in the styrofoam whereas three more }\DIFaddend for the bags \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and one for the AirCore. For the inside pressure in the bags, one more sensor will be located insidethe manifold. To have redundancy, each of the measurements mentioned above will be made with three different sensors }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{will be placed in the valve center. Temperature inside the bags/AirCore is assumed to quickly adjust to the ambient temperature, therefore there will not be differentiation in between inside/outside temperature. In total, there will be six pressure sensors and six temperature sensors}\DIFaddend . 


The sampling of the AAC will be triggered by the pressure \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{read }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{reading }\DIFaddend from the sensors \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{inside the valve center}\DIFaddend . When the required pressure is reached, the valve will open and the sampling will start. The closing of the valve depends on two conditions and it will be triggered when either one of the conditions is true. These conditions are: maximum sampling time or maximum pressure difference between inside/outside the bags. They are determined from past research but in the future will be determined by testing. 

The emptying and sampling sequence is represented in Figures \ref{fig:ascent} and \ref{fig:descent}. It should be kept in mind that the different pressures are what triggers the opening of the valves.

\subsection{Experiment Interfaces}

\subsubsection{Mechanical Interfaces}
The experiment box will be fixed to the gondola rails by means of 4 screws interfacing the experiment outside structure with the hammer nuts in the rails. 90-degree aluminum angles will be used to provide this interface.This method is secure as well as fast enough to provide an accessible and easy recuperation for the later analysis. 

Lateral and top handles will be mounted to facilitate the experiment box manipulation when moving it in and out of the gondola. 

In order to collect reliable air samples, the experiment requires to be mounted at least with one side exposed to the outside. The later will reduce the pipe length used to collect clean air. Three tubes will extend from the experiment box face, see \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Figures \ref{fig:pipes_interface}and \ref{fig:pipes_interface_1}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Figure \ref{fig:pipes_interface}}\DIFaddend . One for the CAC sampling and two, input and output, for the AAC sampling. The one-way selected method will provide a proper flushing of the pipe and thus ensure a reliable sampling as explained in section \ref{Experiment_Setup}.

\begin{centering}
The E-Link connection shall be made between the experiment and the E-Link system using a RJ45 connection which will be supplied by SSC and an Ethernet protocol. The Amphenol RJF21B connector will be mounted on either the front or the side of the experiment\cite{BexusManual}.  
\end{centering}

\subsubsection{Structure}

The experiment consists on two cubic boxes, one stacked next to the other. The smallest box \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{-in red in Figure \ref{overview}- }\DIFaddend allocates the heaviest element, the CAC. The main \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{box }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{box-in grey in Figure \ref{overview}- }\DIFaddend contains the AAC system as well as the general Electronic Box (EB). The frame of these two boxes will be made of aluminum bars which have a characteristic cross-section of 20x20 mm, see Figure \ref{cross-section}. The rails will allow an easy interface between bars and other elements. Bars will be joined together by using 90-degree angles \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and corner cubes}\DIFaddend , see Figure \ref{3_bars_joined}.

\end{figure}

The frame is designed to withstand all vibrations and ensure a reliable stability of the entire system. Further tests will help to confirm and update the design if necessary. 

The two-box design will allow ease of access and manipulation of both the CAC and AAC subsystems, see Figure \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{strucutre}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{overview}}\DIFaddend . In addition, the AAC sampling system is designed to be re-usable for future handover to FMI, as such, it will be mountable on any standard balloon flight without having to introduce major design changes. The latter would imply to introduce a battery as a power unit, hence less bags could be carried (around \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{8 bagsin the new setup)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{6 bags) in this potential future setup}\DIFaddend .

\subsubsection{CAC Subsystem}

The CAC subsystem is designed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to fit }\DIFaddend a 300-meter coiled tube, the valve governing it and a temperature sensor. To determine its positioning inside the gondola and the experiment box, some mechanical issues \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and gondola constraints }\DIFaddend must be considered.

\smallskip
Firstly, it is possible to identify the interface to attach the experiment box to the gondola as one of the most critical points in terms of mechanics performance. In the worst case scenario, with a heavy experiment and without a proper study of the aforesaid interface, shear in the screws could be produced after a violent landing stress. Since the CAC will be the heaviest component in the whole experiment, its location and orientation will affect directly the stress analysis of the structure. The larger the distance to the fixed points, the bigger the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Momentum }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{momentum }\DIFaddend produced by the component. Nevertheless, due to fast recovery implementation, the CAC tube will be placed vertically. Therefore, its dedicated box will be properly attached to the AAC box by means of 4 anchor points\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, in blacb in Figure \ref{overview}}\DIFaddend . The fast recovery then will only imply unscrewing 4 screws and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{disconnect }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{disconnecting }\DIFaddend a wire. 

\smallskip
In order to command the valve, a wire will go out from the box and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{plugged on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{connected to }\DIFaddend the electronics interface panel located on an AAC box wall.

\smallskip
In addition, to avoid sample contamination with standstill air inside the gondola, the coil will have a direct outside inlet and outlet by means of an extension tube reaching further from the gondola‚Äôs limits\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, in blue in the red box in Figure \ref{overview}}\DIFaddend .


\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \pagebreak
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \subsubsection{AAC Subsystem}

The AAC Subsystem consists of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{10 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{7 }\DIFaddend three-liter sampling bags. Each bag will have a dedicated valve in the Valve Center (VC) to allow emptying and filling processes as well as to close the bag when needed. The bags will be placed vertically and will have two anchor points: on the top through a  multiple anchor interface (see Figure \ref{anchor_bags}) and on the bottom by means of the tubes connecting them to the valves.

%% Several Figures of the top box with its inside elements: isometric, top view and front view.

\DIFdelend \subsubsection{Electronics Box}

The OBC and its external elements will be allocated in a bottom corner of the experiment box, inside AAC box, and on the opposite side of the CAC box. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The latter }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This }\DIFaddend will allow an easy access and manipulation as well as the required external interfaces\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, holes in Figure \ref{overview}}\DIFaddend . The smallest side of the EB will have the outer connections interfaces. Hence, the wall will have the necessary holes. The EB will be fixed to the AAC box structure bars in 3 different points.

\subsubsection{Valve Center}

The valve center consists of a coated box to which the AAC's \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{10 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{7 }\DIFaddend air sampling bags will be attached to. This box will serve as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the air flow }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{airflow }\DIFaddend chamber. It will be connected to a pipe from which outside air will be pumped and also enable pre-sample collection flushing\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, see Figure \ref{valve_center_and_pipes}}\DIFdelend . The pump providing the airflow will be allocated on the inlet side and protected by an air filter. It will be allocated inside a shielding box, more detailed information in section \ref{Thermal_section}. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The pipes used for both intake and outlet can be seen in blue in the grey box in Figure \ref{overview}.
}\DIFaddend 

\smallskip
Both the pump box and the valve center will be allocated above the EB so all the command center is at the same place. Having them together will provide as well a proper cooling system monitored by several temperature sensors. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A sketch of the setup can be seen in Figure ....

\DIFdelend \subsubsection{Protection}

In order to protect the components from all kind of external elements, the experiment box will be shielded with removable aluminum walls along with a thick layer of Styrofoam combined with Polyethylene foam attached to each wall. No internal space will be lost since the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{total }\DIFaddend foam thickness is the same as that of the structural bars. Isolating sheets will also be glued in the walls to reinforce the temperature shielding.
%DIF < Each box has an internal aluminum mesh at the bottom face. It will help to protect the CAC coiled tube from impacts as well as to withstand its considerable mass. On the other hand, the mesh in the upper box is used to fix the valve center at a privileged centered position.

The walls will properly protect both the CAC coiled tube and the AAC sampling bags from any external element, unexpected rapid movements, and a probable hard landing impact.

\DIFdelend \subsubsection{Fixing Interface}

The two experiment box subsystem structures will be joined together by four anchor points\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, in black in Figure \ref{overview}}\DIFaddend . On the front and back side, two flat plates with two bolts each will interface both structures. 

This method will allow for easy and fast recovery of the CAC box.

\DIFdelend \subsubsection{Manipulation Interface}

The two-box system will be fixed to the gondola rails by using four 90-degree angles, 2 per rail. All the anchor points \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to the gondola }\DIFaddend will be in the AAC box since the CAC box will be already attached \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the itby four anchor points}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to it}\DIFaddend . The latter also ensures that the AAC box will remain properly fixed in the gondola after the CAC fast recovery. 

\smallskip
In order to access the experiment once fixed in the gondola, the walls could be removed when necessary providing access in all three directions. They can be screwed in again once the manipulation is done.


Several handles will be placed to allow an easy and safe manipulation of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the experiment box in }\DIFdelend both the CAC and the AAC boxes.

\subsubsection{Block Diagrams}
\begin{centering}
The electronics design can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:electronics-block-diagram} and the interfaces this requires can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:eee-interface-diagram}. There will be four distinct areas, the Electronics box, the valve centre, the pump box and the CAC system. All connections to the outside of the box are located in the electronics box. These are the voltage regulators for the external power source and the Ethernet shield with an SD data storage which will connect to the Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT\&C). Additionally one pressure sensor, one heater and one temperature sensor will be placed in this area. The CAC system area will contain three temperature sensors to monitor its ambient temperature and one electronic valve to be closed before landing. In the AAC system area there will be eleven valves, one airflow sensor, one pressure sensor, five temperature and one humidity sensor and a heater. In the pump box there will be the miniature diaphragm air pump, one temperature sensor and one heater.

This is in excess of the required flow rate as the flow rate will decrease as the altitude increases. As the pressure decreases the current required by the pump will increase until it hits a peak current draw of 340mA. However as seen in Figure \ref{fig:pumpflowcur} the peak current then decreases as the pressure continues to decrease. It is also worth noting that whilst the flow rate appears to decrease too much Figure \ref{fig:pumpflowcur} is assuming that this is the pressure differential. Our bags will not be at vacuum and they will not be pressurized therefore the expected flow rate performance is higher.

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Electromagnetically Controlled Valves}}
\DIFadd{Filling of the air bags will be controlled by the solenoid valves. For this purpose Parker solenoid valve 121K63, Figure \ref{fig:valve},  with the 24 VDC coil, Figure \ref{fig:coil}, has been selected after careful consideration of the different options available in the market and keeping the experiment requirements in mind. The valves will be normally closed through out the experiment with zero power consumption and will be open, when given power, to fill up the air bags at specific altitudes or to flush the tubes.

They will also have a connection to the Arduino so that they can be controlled. In order to allow this connection a switching circuit has been devised using a power MOSFET and a BJT. This circuit is detailed in Figure \ref{fig:switchcir}.

\subsection{Thermal Design} \label{Thermal_section}

\DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{\DIFadd{Thermal Environment}}
\DIFaddend \begin{centering}
The experiment will experience a wide range of temperatures during the flight and it must be able to continue to operate despite these changes. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:temperature-profile} the coldest point of the flight will be between 15km and 20km where the air temperature can drop to $-80\degree$C and temperatures on the gondola have been recorded as low as $-40\degree$C during the float phase in the past \cite{BexusManual}. In addition launching from Kiruna in late October means the temperature on the ground could be as low as $-15\degree$C. As our lowest operating temperature component must be at a minimum of $0\degree$C this could mean heaters may need to be switched on while the experiment is still on the ground. 
\end{centering}

    \caption{Diagram showing the temperature profile of the atmosphere \cite{jacob}}\label{fig:temperature-profile}
\end{figure}

\DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{\DIFadd{Overall Design}}
\DIFaddend \begin{centering}
To protect the components against the cold two heaters will be included. One of these will be placed close to the Arduino, which is anticipated to be able to keep the controller area warm enough, and the second will be placed close to the valves to ensure they continue to operate as expected. To control these heaters two temperature sensors will also be onboard in similar locations. If the reading from one of the temperature sensors is lower than the predefined value then the heater will turn on. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The predefined value will be chosen based upon the minimum operating temperature of the components. It is also expected that the electrical components will produce some heat themselves.
}\DIFdelend \end{centering}


\begin{centering}
In addition to using electrical heaters the experiment will also be thermally insulated. The Styrofoam casing which will be used to protect the CAC from impact forces will also serve as insulation. It is also planned to add additional insulation around the components.  
\end{centering}

\begin{centering}
It is also important to consider heating from the sun which could raise the temperature of the experiment considerably. Sufficient insulation should be included to ensure the inside of the box stays within the operating temperature range. This will be investigated at a later date when a full CFD thermal analysis is completed.

\DIFadd{One heater }\DIFaddend will be included in the electronics box with its main priority being keeping the Arduino Due board within operational temperatures \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{whilst }\DIFaddend delivering the remaining heat to peripheral electronics. The other heater will be fitted between the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{diaphragm of the }\DIFdelend pump and the entrances to the valve center and will \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{carry the task of keeping }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{keep }\DIFaddend its lateral neighbors within their respective \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{functional }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{operational }\DIFaddend temperature ranges.

The pump has the most critical temperature range \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as }\DIFaddend it is the only component that cannot operate below freezing temperatures\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{- in fact, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.

\cite{LISA}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, tests will be conducted on the pump to find its true performance at lower temperatures. }\DIFaddend The valves are also crucial to the experiment's function, as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{their correct function is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{they are }\DIFaddend what enables each and every sampling bag onboard to be used. For this reason, while the valves can operate down to $-43\degree$C, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{they still need to be kept }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{it is desirable to be keep them }\DIFaddend above this limit whenever in use.

Given the thermal conductivity of EPDM ($0.2 W/(m.K)$), the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pump's }\DIFaddend diaphragm experiences a minimal temperature drop across itself when one side is subject to the heater's temperature while the other end of the pump is leveled with the ambient temperature. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Case in point, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Through calculation }\DIFaddend it was found that at an ambient temperature of $-50\degree$C and a heater temperature at $10\degree$C, that the center of the pump\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{- }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend the far end of the diaphragm\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{- }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend measured $9.35\degree$C. Reassessing the equation yielded the most energy-conserving temperature that would keep the pump's diaphragm above the minimum requirement to be $7\degree$C\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{- and this }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. This }\DIFaddend held whether the temperature \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{were }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend as it could be on ground level ($-10\degree$C), or in floating phase ($-50\degree$C).

Due to the relatively high loading that will be placed on the DC-DC converter by the valves it was decided to use two DC-DC converters to step down from 28.8V to 24V giving the pump its own dedicated DC-DC converter. This is as the pump and valves both have a high peak current draw. The Arduino will also have its own DC-DC converter stepping the voltage down from 28.8V to 12V. It is thought using three DC-DC converters will provide the best compromise between efficiency, cost and heating.

\subsection{Software Design}
\subsubsection{Purpose}
The purpose of the software is to automatically control the valves so that they will be opened/closed at the designated altitude. Moreover, the software will store housekeeping data from sensors, pump and valves states to the on-board memory storage device. To determine a vertical profile, the acquisition of sensor data is required. From Olivier's research:
\begin{quote}
"In order to determine the vertical profiles of CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ from the analysis of sampled air, measurements of several atmospheric parameters are needed (see Sect. 2.3). The two most important parameters are the ambient pressure and the mean coil temperature. Those parameters are recorded by the AirCore-HR electronic data package. Mean coil temperature is obtained by taking the mean of three temperatures recorded by independent probes located at different positions along the AirCore-HR".\cite{Olivier}
\end{quote}
The next purpose is to transmit such data to the ground. It will allow the team to monitor the real-time condition of the experiment. Telecommand is also needed to take over the experiment if the software automation fails, since this experiment is highly dependent on the software. It will also be used to test the system, especially valves and heaters.\par
\subsubsection{Design}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item{Process Overview}\\
The software which run on Arduino Due reads from the sensors through the I2C interface. The sensors provides temperature, pressure, airflow and humidity data. The acquired data will be time-stamped and stored on the on-board SDcard and transmitted via the E-Link System to the ground station. Then according to the pressure/altitude, the software controls the valves which will allow the air to flow inside the tube and bags. Figure \ref{processOverview} visually explain the process flow.
\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{4-experiment-design/img/Process-overview-V0-1.png}
    \caption{The process overview of the experiment}
    \label{processOverview}
\end{figure}
\item{General and Safety related concepts}\\
Watchdog timer, which is an electronic countdown timer that causes an interrupt when it reaches 0, will be used to avoid failure because of a freezing software. During normal operations, the software will regularly reset the the watchdog timer to prevent it from elapsing, or \enquote{timing out}. Telecommands will also be used as backup in case the automation fails or otherwise become unresponsive. Telemetry will be utilized to transmit housekeeping data and the state of the valves to get conformation of operation. Rigorous testing will be performed during the development of the project and before the launch phase to insure that that the software is capable to control the experiment.\\
\\
Watchdog has been suggested to be removed in Preliminary Design Review. However, it is still a good feature for automatic reset in case the software freeze/stuck. Therefore, the watchdog will be kept and shall be tested before Critical Design Review.
\item{Interfaces}\\
Table \ref{tab:comIntpro} demonstrates how the components will interact with the onboard computer (OBC). Components that use SPI, will share MISO, MOSI, and CLK pins on the Arduino board. Each of them will also be connected to general pins input output (GPIO) for slave select. Furthermore, components using I2C protocol, will share Serial Data pin (SDA) and Serial Clock pin (SCL).

Every transmission to/from the ground will utilize the E-link connection. The data packet which will be used is Ethernet Packet with a header contains the address of destination, followed by the data, and at the end there is a frame check sequence (FCS). The up-linked data packet will have the same structure, with header followed by commands and ended with FCS.
\item{Data Acquisition and Storage}\\
Data will be stored on the SD memory card on the Arduino Ethernet Shield. It is estimated that for the entire flight, all the sensors will produce $650$ kilo bytes or $5.2$ mega bits of data. The sampling rates of the sensors are dependent on the modes (see Figure \ref{fig:modediag}). In standby mode, the sampling rate is $1$ per $10$ seconds, since this is not the essential part. The sampling rate is increased in the Normal Operation (ascent) mode to $1$ per seconds. Moreover, in the the descent phase of the experiment, the sampling rate will be increased significantly to $10$ per one second.\\
\\
The data will be collected and presented as a matrix, where the first column is the time frame, the following columns are the sensors data. After the sensors data, there will also be housekeeping data, that keeps track of the valves, and heaters states. However, the size of the housekeeping data is not expected to surpass 20 bits per sampling.\\

Data will be continuously down-linked and the total telemetry size is 4.788 MB for 5 hours of flight.
\item{Process Flow}\\
The process flow can be explained with the mode diagram in figure \ref{fig:modediag}. The software will start with Standby Mode, in which the software will get samples from all sensors. When the software got reading of pressure changes (decrease), it will change to Normal - Ascent mode, where the software will empty the tube and bags by opening the valves. Then, at certain altitudes, air sampling will be conducted during ascending phase. During floating phase, there will be nothing conducted. The software will go to Normal - Descent mode when it sense when the pressure reduction is considerably big, where the software will sample the air by opening the valves for each bag in their designated altitude. The air sampling during descent phase will only be started after the gondola stabilize after cut-off. The software will know this by the reduction of pressure value readings. The experiment goes to SAFE mode about $500 \, m$ before the landing, where all the valves will be closed.

    \caption{Onboard Software Design Tree}\label{fig:obtree}
\end{figure}
The software design is produced by using object oriented approach. The functionality of the experiment has been divided into several objects and their children. The design tree is shown in Figure \ref{fig:obtree}.\\
\\
The Telemetry object is responsible to format the sensor/housekeeping data, and to transmit it. MODE is responsible for controlling the four modes of software. INIT will initialize the necessary software programs. COMMANDS reads the telecommands and execute their commands. The AIR SAMPLING CONTROL object have the four children objects. The first child is responsible for controlling the pump. The second child contains the parameters for the valves and pump. The third child reads the data from the sensors, a fourth child is responsible for manipulating the valves.\\
\\
The SENSOR object have two children objects. One for sampling the sensors and another for recording and storing the housekeeping data. The HEATER object have three children objects. One for reading the temperature sensor data, another for deciding if the heaters should be turn on/off. And the third child for turning it on/off.\\ 
\\
Each of the objects interacts with each others fulfilling mutually exclusive interaction. It means that any shared variables can only be accessed by one object at time. This is important considering the program is be fully automatic and to prevent unnecessary data lost. The objects interface diagrams and their sequence diagrams can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:appB} and \ref{sec:appC}.

\section{Experiment Verification and Testing}

\subsection{Verification Matrix}

The verification matrix is made following the standard of \textit{ECSS-E-10-02A}. \cite{ECSSSecretariat}

\textit{There are four established verification methods:}
\newline \textit{A - Verification by analysis or similarity}
\newline \textit{I - Verification by inspection}
\newline \textit{R - Verification by review-of-design}
%\newline \textit{S - Verification by similarity}
\newline \textit{T - Verification by testing}

Currently, no verification has yet transpired due to the hardware and software components potentially fitting the requirements still being sought and ordered and/or requested. As the project advances and the parts for each division arrive or are developed, the verification methods will be revised, and test numbers and status will be assigned.

\subsubsection{Launch Site Requirements}
A laptop PC will be used to monitor the experiment. Therefore, a desk and a chair are needed for this station. A total of 13 chairs need to be rented: 10 chairs for all members of team TUBULAR and an additional 3 for visiting collaborators from FMI. One power outlet and one Ethernet cable for E-link connection are also essential for the laptop PC.

\subsubsection{Flight Requirements}

Floating altitude is desired to be as high as possible in order to sample air from the stratosphere both in ascent and decent phase. The duration of the float phase is not relevant for the experiment performance. 

\smallskip
No conditions for visibility are required for this experiment.

\smallskip
With respect to a swift recovery and transport for fast data analysis, a launch time in the early morning hours would be favorable.

\pagebreak
\subsubsection{Accommodation Requirements}

The experiment involves two cubic boxes inside the gondola environment. The only requirement is to allocate the box with at least one face exposed to the outside. The latter will also facilitate the fast experiment recovery for the later analysis of the collected samples. The design allows full adaptability regarding the interface with the gondola's rails, for more detail see section \ref{Mechanical_Design}. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The current location of the experiment in Figure \ref{goldola_accommodation} is the one arranged with RXBX Coordinator during the Training Week in Esrange.

\pagebreak
\subsection{Preparation and Test Activities at Esrange}
The ground station laptop PC will need to be put in place and operational. The communication through E-link with the experiment shall be tested. The air sampling itinerary has to be checked before flight.

What is more, in a preparation phase, short (15 cm) lengths of stainless steel tubing, will be filled with fresh magnesium perchlorate powder \cite{Karion} and will be attached to either end of the CAC tubing, to ensure that no moisture will enter the tubing during any testing or sampling.

Magnesium perchlorate powder will be used for the AAC. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:pipes_interface} the filter, in front of the valve center, will be coated with magnesium perchlorate to prevent moisture from entering while sampling. 

Before the launch, both CAC and AAC will be filled with  an inert gas. All the bags will be manually emptied before flight. Flushing of the CAC tube will be done passively through the progressive decrease in air pressure during the balloon's ascent phase. Nitrogen will be used as the inert gas. Nitrogen's triple bond is very strong and requires a lot of energy to break those bonds and participate in a reaction. That is why nitrogen is used, despite the fact that is not truly inert like most noble gases.

In a laboratory phase, tests under monitored conditions will be done to evaluate the overall consistency of the CAC and the AAC. In particular, the CAC and the AAC shall be tested for leaks at the junctions and at the valves. 

Should a gas chromatograph be made available on site, pre-flight testing will be made to ensure sample concentration preservation. To do so, calibrated dry standard gases of two different values for both CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ will be used. One with high CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ concentrations, i.e high-concentration calibration standard, and one with lower concentrations, i.e low-concentration standard. Should a gas chromatograph not be available, this activity will be incorporated in the latter part of the Experiment Building and Testing stage.
\pagebreak
\subsection{Timeline for Countdown and Flight}
Table \ref{tab:countflight} is the estimated timeline during countdown and flight. It may undergo updates in future versions of the SED.

The desired altitudes in which air samples are to be collected with the air sampling bags are associated with specific air pressure values. Thus, the valve operations to sample air during the balloon ascent and descent phases are to be triggered by readings from the ambient pressure sensor. The time values presented in Table \ref{tab:countflight} merely serve as an indicative estimate of when the sampling will take place as sampling will not be programmed based on flight time.

\subsection{Post Flight Activities}

To ensure minimize the length of time in which mixing of the gas occurs in the collected CAC samples, is necessary that the they  be analyzed as soon as possible after the experiment landing. Measurements will be made in partnership with the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) thus it is necessary that the experiment can be transported to the measurement equipment provided by FMI. To make measurements at the landing site would be unfeasible due to the size of the gas analyzer hence measurements are to be made at the Esrange Space Centre.

The FMI team would begin their travel to Esrange as soon as the balloon landing site has been located. Once the experiment has been recovered to Esrange the samples will be analyzed by the FMI equipment and the preliminary results will be found. The disadvantages of this option are that additional time in between the gas collection and the analysis means a loss of vertical resolution in the sample and the transportation of the equipment from Sodankyl√§ to Esrange may result in calibration loss due to equipment vibrations caused by transportation. The ideal scenario for would be to have the FMI team be at Esrange the day before the launch despite the possibility of waiting time in case of short notice launch cancellations. This would give margins to react to unforeseen problems such as trouble on the road due to bad weather as well as missing equipment and/or tools. Furthermore, this would allow additional time to install and calibrate their lab equipment at Esrange prior to the launch.

Special consideration will be put into designing the experiment so that the recovery team can easily remove the experiment from its enclosure for possible transportation back to Esrange via helicopter. Detailed instructions will be provided on operating the detachable mechanism that will be designed. In addition, instructions will be provided to ensure that the system is completely shut down and the valves secured. Shutdown will be automated however a manual shutdown mechanism will be included should the automation fail.

The analysis results that will then be used for the post flight meeting. Further analysis will then be carried out to fully understand the data. Once a full analysis of the data has been completed there is the potential for publication of research findings.

\section{Data Analysis and Results}

\subsection{Data Analysis Plan}

After the flight the collected samples, from the CAC and the AAC, will be analyzed with a Picarro gas analyzer. The end of the CAC that remains closed during sampling, will be opened first, and connected to the gas standard with the higher CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ concentrations. The reason for that, is to have a notable difference between the standard gas and the stratospheric air sample. The other end of the CAC will be connected to the analyzer. The analyzer pump will pull the sample through the analyzer with both ends of the CAC open, so that the standard gas will be pulled through after the sample finish, \cite{Karion}, \cite{Olivier}.
After the sample has been analyzed, the time trace of analysis will be converted into a mole fraction profile as a function of atmospheric pressure, using the ideal gas law,
\begin{equation}
    PV = nRT <=> n = \frac{PV}{RT}
    \label{eq:idealgaslaw}
\end{equation}
where P is the ambient pressure, V is the inner volume of the CAC/AAC, n the fraction of moles, R is the universal gas constant in $J K^{-1} mol^{-1}$ and T the ambient temperature in Kelvin, \cite{Olivier}. 
A constant unit of pressure in the atmosphere is represented by a unit of length in the CAC tube, due to the method that the CAC will sample the ambient air.
During the analysis the number of moles that will go through the analyzer will increase linearly with time. So, the number of moles at any time during the analysis will be
\begin{equation}
    n_i = n^{max}\frac{t_i}{\Delta t}
    \label{eq:ni}
\end{equation}
where $n^{max}$ is the maximum number of moles i.e when the CAC reaches the Earth's surface, and $\Delta t$  is the total time duration of the analysis between the top and bottom of the CAC sample.   
Finally, the vertical profiles will be obtained by using equations \ref{eq:idealgaslaw} and \ref{eq:ni}, and relate a specific pressure point with every Picarro measurement of the sample.   

The AAC sampling system will be analyzed, in the same manner as the CAC, using the same Picarro gas analyzer. The vertical profiles for CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ are going to be obtained using again, equations \ref{eq:idealgaslaw} and \ref{eq:ni}.

\subsection{Launch Campaign}
No launch campaign activities are currently defined. This will be elaborated on in future SEDs.
\subsection{Results}

No results for now. More will come after the launch campaign in an updated version of the SED. 

\subsubsection{Expected Results}

After the analysis of the samples, the expected results are the vertical profiles of CO$_2$ and CH$_4$. The profiles will be similar to that of Figure \ref{fig:vertical-profile-karion}. The continuous profile (dashed line) belongs to the CAC while the discrete values (black dots) belongs to the AAC (\cite{Karion}). Both profiles are decreasing with increasing altitude.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{align*}
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{7-data-analysis-and-results/img/ExpectedVerticalProfilesKarion.png}
    \end{align*}
    \caption{Pressure profiles for (left) CO$_2$ and (right) CH$_4$ by three different methods.\cite{Karion}\label{fig:vertical-profile-karion}}
\end{figure}

The experiment's goal is to achieve the higher vertical resolution possible. Since the vertical resolution is determined by the length and the diameter of the tube \cite{Olivier}, for the experiment a 300m long tube will be used, consisting of 2 smaller tubes. One of 200m length with \num{3e-3} m outside diameter and \num{1.3e-4} m wall thickness, and another one of 100m length with \num{6e-3} m outside diameter and \num{1.3e-4} m wall thickness. For achieving higher stratospheric resolution, the tube with the smaller diameter will be used to sample the higher altitudes and the one with the bigger diameter for the lower ones.
Figure \ref{fig:resolution-lenght} by Olivier Membrive \cite{Olivier} compares the vertical resolution that can be expected with three different AirCores.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{align*}
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{7-data-analysis-and-results/img/ResolutionVslength.png}
    \end{align*}
    \caption{Comparison of the vertical resolutions that can be expected with different AirCores, after 3h storage time before analysis.\cite{Olivier}\label{fig:resolution-lenght}}
\end{figure}

The AirCore-HR (red line),\cite{Olivier}, is a combination of two tubes. One of 200m and one of 100m.

The NOAA 'original' CAC, \cite{Karion}, (black line) is a 152m long tube and the AirCore-GUF (designed and developed at Goethe University Frankfurt), (blue line) is a combination of three tubes, 100m long in total.

The longer AirCore, AirCore-HR, achieved a higher resolution throughout the whole sampled air. 

In addition, the vertical resolution depends on the the mixing inside the tube. 

The experiment takes into account two types of mixing. Molecular diffusion and the shear flow diffusion, known as Taylor dispersion. The effect of molecular diffusion is described by the root-mean-square of the distance of molecular travel, 
\begin{equation}
    X_{rms} = \sqrt{2Dt}
\end{equation}
where, D is the molecular diffusivity of the molecule in the surrounding gas, and t is the time over which travel occurs, \cite{Karion}.
For the tubing dimension that will be used in this experiment, the flow of air through the AirCore, will be laminar. In such a flow, a parabolic velocity profile exists inside the tube, causing longitudinal mixing (Taylor dispersion). 
 Before the experiment is recovered, only molecular diffusion will affect the sample, but during analysis both molecular diffusion and Taylor dispersion will affect the sample.
 Combining both of them, an effective diffusion coefficient can be calculated as,
 \begin{equation}
     D{eff} = D + \frac{a^2\overline{V^2}}{48D}
 \end{equation}
where D is the molecular diffusivity, a is the tube's inner radius, and $\overline{V}$ is the average velocity \cite{Olivier}. The first term translates into the longitudinal direction, while the second one is the Taylor dispersion.

The exact flow rates are going to be decided at a later stage of the experiment.

Finally, storage time (time from the moment the tube is sealed until the end of the analysis) is a key factor that affects the experiment's results in terms of resolution.
Figure \ref{fig:resolution-time} shows the effect of time delay between landing and analysis, on the expected vertical resolution. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{align*}
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{7-data-analysis-and-results/img/ResolutionVsTime.png}
    \end{align*}
    \caption{Expected vertical resolution of AirCore-HR, for a storage time of 3h (black), 6h (blue), 12h (green), 24h (orange) and 1 week (red). \cite{Olivier}\label{fig:resolution-time}}
\end{figure}

It is clear that the sooner the samples are going to be analyzed, the better the results for the vertical resolution of the CAC sample. At an altitude of 20km the resolution decreases significantly from 300m to 500m for 6h and 12h of delay, respectively, \cite{Olivier}. But even after a week of storage, a vertical profile can still be achieved with lower resolution.

Based on past BEXUS projects, the time to experiment recovery is estimated at 12 to 24 hours if not multiple days. As such, it is expected that the desired vertical resolution of gas analysis will favour AAC configuration over that of CAC due to mixing of gases in the latter configuration, resulting in poorer vertical resolution.



The targeted vertical resolution for the AAC is 500m. This will be achieved assuring the airflow intake rate. For ascent phase, a nominal speed of 5m/s is considered, which means that it will take 100 seconds to fill up a 3L sampling bag while ascending 500m, and therefore the airflow intake rate should be of approximately 1.8L/min. For descent phase, the nominal speed is assumed to be 8m/s. While descending 500m a 3L sampling bag will be filled in 62 seconds.
But considering the fact that the pump will not have the same efficiency at higher altitudes, the sampling time may be longer and the airflow intake rate may be higher. The exact numbers will be included in the upcoming version of the SED.  

For a 500m of vertical displacement, the horizontal resolution of the AAC has been approximated based on past BEXUS flights data obtained from the BEXUS manual \cite{BexusManual}. The average horizontal resolution obtained for ascent phase is 588m and for descent phase is 186.5m. This means that the square area covered by the sample will be 500m x 588m and 500m x 186.5m for ascent and descent phases respectively.



It is expected that the AAC will serve as model enabling a cost-effective large scale deployment scheme for regular high altitude greenhouse gas measurement. Unlike CAC, the design of AAC will not impose experimental restrictions based on the proximity of infrastructure for shipping and analysis. As such, a successful proof of concept of AAC sampling system will serve as a basis to enable reliable cost-effective measurements in remote areas.
