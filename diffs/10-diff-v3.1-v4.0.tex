\DIFaddbegin \newpage
\DIFaddend Carbon dioxide (CO$_{2}$), methane (CH$_{4}$), and carbon monoxide (CO) are three main greenhouse gases emitted by human activities. Developing a better understanding of their contribution to greenhouse effects requires more accessible, flexible, and scalable air sampling mechanisms. A balloon flight is the most cost-effective mechanism to obtain a vertical air profile through continuous sampling between the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere. However, recovery time constraints due to gas mixture concerns geographically restrict the sampling near existing research centers where analysis of the recovered samples can take place. The TUBULAR experiment is a technology demonstrator for atmospheric research supporting an air sampling mechanism that would offer climate change researchers access to remote areas by minimizing the effect of gas mixtures within the collected samples so that recovery time is no longer a constraint. The experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will include }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{includes }\DIFaddend a secondary sampling mechanism that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will serve }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{serves }\DIFaddend as reference against which the proposed sampling mechanism can be validated.

payload has been made available to students from other European countries through a collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA).

EuroLaunch, a cooperation between the Esrange Space Center of SSC and the Mobile Rocket Base (MORABA) of DLR, is responsible for the campaign management and operations of the launch vehicles. Experts from DLR, SSC, ZARM, and ESA provide
technical support to the student teams throughout the project.

The Student Experiment Documentation (SED) is a continuously updating document regarding the BEXUS student experiment TUBULAR - Alternative to AirCore for Atmospheric Greenhouse Gas Sampling and will undergo reviews during the preliminary design review, the critical design review, the integration progress review, and final experiment report.

The TUBULAR Team consists of a diverse and inter-disciplinary group of students from LuleÃ¥ University of Technology's Masters programme in Atmospheric Studies, Space Engineering, and Spacecraft Design. The idea for the proposed experiment stems from concerns over the realities of climate change as a result of human activity coupled with the complexity and limitations in obtaining greenhouse gas profile data to support climate change research.

Based above the Arctic circle in Kiruna, Sweden, the TUBULAR Team is exposed to Arctic science research with which it will collaborate in order to produce a research detailing the air sampling methodology, measurements, analysis, and findings.

% MAIN TEXT DOCUMENT 
\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Scientific Background}

The ongoing and increasingly rapid melting of the Arctic ice cap has served as a reference to the global climate change. Researchers have noted that \enquote{the Arctic is warming about twice as fast as the rest of the world} \cite{Perkins} and projecting an ice-free Arctic Ocean as a realistic scenario in future summers similar to the Pliocene Epoch when \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \enquote{global temperature was only 2â3Â°C warmer than today} %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \enquote{global temperature was only 2â3\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$\degree{C}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
warmer than today} \DIFaddend \cite{Trace}. Suggestions that additional loss of Arctic sea ice can be avoided by reducing air pollutant and CO$_{2}$ growth still require confirmation through better climate effect measurements of CO$_{2}$ and non-CO$_{2}$ forcings \cite{Trace}. Such measurements bear high costs, particularly in air sampling for trace gas concentrations in the region between the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere which have a significant effect on the Earth's climate. There is little information on distribution of trace gases at the stratosphere due to the inherent difficulty of measuring gases above aircraft altitudes.

Trace gases are gases which make up less than 1\% of the Earth's atmosphere. They include all gasses except Nitrogen, and Oxygen. In terms of climate change, the main concern for the scientific community is that of CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ concentrations which make up less than 0.1\% of the trace gases and are referred to as Greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gas concentrations are measured in parts per million (ppm), and parts per billion (ppb). They are the main offenders of the greenhouse effect caused by human activity as they trap heat into the atmosphere. Larger emissions of greenhouse gases lead to higher concentrations of those gases in the atmosphere thus contributing to climate change.

\subsection{Mission Statement}

There is little information on the distribution of trace gases at the stratosphere due to the inherent difficulty and high cost of air sampling above aircraft altitudes \cite{Trace}. The experiment seeks to contribute to and support climate change research by proposing and validating a low-cost air sampling mechanism that reduces the current complexities and limitations of obtaining data on stratospheric greenhouse gas distribution.
\pagebreak
\subsection{Experiment Objectives}

Beyond providing knowledge on greenhouse gas distributions, the sampling obtained from the experiment will serve as a reference to validate the robustness and reliability of the proposed sampling system through comparative analysis of results obtained with a reference sampling system.

The primary objective of the experiment consists of validating the proposed sampling system as a reliable mechanism that enables sampling of stratospheric greenhouse gases in remote areas. Achieving this objective consists of developing a cost-effective and re-usable stratospheric air sampling system (i.e. AAC). Samples collected by the proposed mechanism are to be compared against samples collected by a proven sampling system (i.e. CAC). The proven sampling system is to be part of the experimental payload as a reference that will validate the proof-of-concept air sampling system.

The secondary objective of the experiment will be to analyze the samples by both systems in a manner that will contribute to climate change research in the Arctic region. The trace gas profiles to be analyzed are that of carbon dioxide (CO$_{2}$), methane (CH$_{4}$), and carbon oxide (CO)\footnote{The third gas being sampled has been changed from N$_{2}$O to CO. The main reason for changing this is that the model of analyzer used is only able to detect CO$_{2}$, CH$_{4}$ and CO.\label{fn:ChangeN2OtoCO}}. The research activities will culminate in a research paper written in collaboration with FMI.

\subsection{Experiment Concept}

The experiment seeks to test the viability and reliability of a proposed cost-effective alternative to the The AirCore Sampling System. The AirCore Sampling System consists of a long and thin stainless steel tube shaped in the form of a coil which takes advantage of changes in pressure during descent to sample the surrounding atmosphere and preserve a profile (see Figure \ref{fig:A1} in Appendix \ref{sec:appA}). Sampling during a balloonâs Descent Phase will result in a profile shape extending the knowledge of distribution of trace gases for the measured column between the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere \cite{Karion}. The proposed experiment will consist of two sampling subsystems: a conventional implementation of AirCore as described above, henceforth referred to as CAC, and a proposed alternative, henceforth referred to as Alternative to AirCore (AAC).

The proposed AAC system is primarily motivated by the CAC sampling mechanism lacking flexibility in choice of coverage area due to the geographical restriction imposed by the irreversible process of gas mixing along the air column sampled in its stainless tube. Because of this, the sampling region for the CAC system needs to remain within proximity to research facilities for post-flight gas analysis. The AAC sampling system is a proposed alternative configuration to the CAC sampling system that has been designed to address this limitation all while improving cost-effectiveness. The AAC sampling system consists of a series of small independent air sampling bags (see Figure \ref{fig:A2} in Appendix \ref{sec:appA}) rather than the CAC's single long and coiled tube. Each sampling bag is to be allocated a vertical sampling range capped at 500 meters so that mixing of gases becomes a lesser concern.

The use of sampling bags in series rather than a single long tube is meant to tackle limitations of the CAC by 1) reducing system implementation cost inherent to the production of a long tube and 2) enabling sampling of remote areas by reducing the effect of mixing of gases in post-analysis. However, the AAC comes with its own limitations as its discrete sampling will not allow for a the type of continuous profiling made possible by the CAC coiled tube. Overall design of AAC will be approached with miniaturization, cost-effectiveness, and design for manufacturability (DFM) in mind with the purpose of enabling ease of replication.

\subsection{Schedule}

Scheduling of the project is presented in a Gantt Chart overview on Figure \ref{fig:schedule-gantt-chart}. Exam period constraints have been included in order to evaluate risks in person-day allocations to project implementation. It is expected during exam periods the team work output will be lower than usual but project activities will continue, therefore time has been planned accordingly to accommodate this:

    \caption{Project Schedule Gantt Chart.}\label{fig:schedule-gantt-chart}
\end{figure}

Deadlines of the five Student Experiment Documentations (SED) versions have been estimated based on past REXUS/BEXUS Cycles. An expanded version of the Gantt Chart with detailed listing of all sub-tasks not shown in Figure \ref{fig:schedule-gantt-chart} can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:appF}. This expanded Gantt Chart includes all tasks related to the test plan and internal deadlines are set so that a first draft of the documentation is completed one week in advance to allow contents to be checked. Build and test internal deadlines are also placed one week in advance to allow a buffer in case things do not go as expected. The tests are scheduled for as early as possible to allow time for rescheduling if the result is a fail. With some high priority tests, see Section \ref{sec:5.2.1-testpriority}, it is expected these will be very difficult to reschedule therefore extra time is built into the test duration to allow for multiple attempts at the test.

The initial projected effort to be contributed by each team member was averaged at 1.5 hour per person per day corresponding to a team total of 15 hours per day. Since then, 3 new members have been included in the team thus increasing the projected daily effort to 19.5 hours per day. During the period leading up to the launch it is expected that the effort contributed will be double to 3 hours per person per day. The period of these different effort capacities are listed in Table \ref{tab:daily-team-effort-per-period}:

All TUBULAR Team members are based in Kiruna, Sweden, just \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{40 kilometers }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\SI{40}{\kilo\meter} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend from Esrange Space Center. Furthermore, all team members are enrolled in LTU Master programmes in Kiruna and thus expected to remain in LTU during the entire project period. Special attention will have to be made for planning tasks during the summer period where many team members are expected to travel abroad. A timeline of team member availability  until January 2019 is available in Appendix \ref{sec:appD}. A significant risk can be observed during the summer months from June to August where most members will only be partially available and some completely unavailable. As such, team member availability and work commitments over the summer have been negotiated across team members in order to guarantee that at least one member per division is present in Kiruna over the Summer with the exception of the Software Division which can work remotely. Furthermore, the Project Manager role will have to be assigned to the Deputy Project Manager due to an extended full time unavailability after the CDR.

As part of their respective Master programmes, most TUBULAR Team members are enrolled in a project course at LTU. The TUBULAR project acts as the course's project for most team members from which they will obtain ECTS credits. This course is supervised by Dr. Thomas Kuhn, Associate Professor at LTU.

\subsubsection{External Support}

Partnership with FMI, and IRF will provide the team with technical guidance in implementing the sampling system. FMIâs experience in implementing past CAC sample systems provide invaluable lessons learned towards conceptualizing, designing, and implementing the proposed AAC sampling system.

FMI is a key partner in the TUBULAR project, its scientific experts will advise and support the TUBULAR project by sharing knowledge, experience, and granting accessibility of equipment. As per the agreement shown in Appendix \ref{sec:appG}, FMI will provide the TUBULAR Team with the AirCore stainless tube component of the CAC subsystem as well as the post-flight gas analyzer. This arrangement requires careful considerations on the placement of the experiment in order to minimize hardware damage risks. These contributions result in significant cost savings regarding equipment and component procurement.

Daily access to LTU's Space Campus in Kiruna exposes the team to scientific mentorship and expert guidance from both professors and researchers involved in the study of greenhouse gases and climate change. Dr Uwe Raffalski, IRF, Associate professor (Docent) is one of many researchers involved in climate study who is mentoring the team.

\section{Experiment Design}
\subsection{Experiment Setup} \label{Experiment_Setup}

The experiment consists of the AAC subsystem, with six sampling bags, and the CAC coiled tube subsystem. Shown in Figure {\ref{fig:3D_tubular_render}}, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{CAC }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{AirCore }\DIFaddend is fitted into the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{partition on the left}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{CAC box}\DIFaddend , and the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{AAC into the partition to the right}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{alternative sampling system with bags in the AAC box, together with the pneumatic system and the electronics placed inside the }\emph{\DIFadd{Brain}}\DIFaddend . The principal aim is to validate the AAC sampling method. To do so, it is necessary to sample during Descent Phase in order to compare the results with the ones obtained from the CAC. This is because the CAC collects its air sample passively by pressure differentials in the descent. Flight speeds mentioned in this section have been obtained from the BEXUS manual as well as through analysis of past flights. Figure \ref{fig:block-diagram} shows a generic block diagram of the main subsystems interconnection.

\end{figure}

The primary concern regarding the AAC air sampling subsystem occurs after the cut-off when the gondola will tumble and fall at an average speed of 50 m/s for approximately two minutes \cite{BexusManual}. This descent speed is too large in order to sample air at the desired vertical resolution, capped at 500 m. As such, sampling can only be done after the gondola has stabilized at a descent speed  of 8 m/s \cite{BexusManual}. The tumbling phase will vertically span for approximately 6 km. Considering a Float Phase altitude of 25 km, sampling during the Descent Phase will commence at approximately 19 km in altitude. However, the primary region of interest in terms of sampling is in the stratosphere, particularly between 19 km and 25 km in altitude. Sampling will thus also occur during the Ascent Phase. Out of the six sampling bags present in the payload, two will be used during the Ascent Phase at 18 km and 21 km and four during the Descent Phase at 17.5 km, 16 km, 14 km and 12 km as seen in Table \ref{tab:minimum-volume}. Details regarding the sampling strategy can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:appH}.

%\input{4-experiment-design/tables/samplingaltitudes.tex}
The maximum pressure that the sampling bags can withstand has to be taken into account in order to avoid bursting. Decreasing pressure during the Ascent Phase poses a risk to sampling bags which already contain samples as the gas inside will expand which may cause the bag to burst. In order to avoid this, the sampling bags will not be completely filled. Filling \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the bags }\DIFaddend up to a maximum \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of 80\% of the sampling bag's capacity (}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pressure of }\DIFaddend 2 psi/0.14 bar\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{/140 hPa or alternatively filling the sampling bag up to 80\% of its capacity  }\DIFaddend is recommended by the manufacturers for the Multi-Layer Foil sampling bags that are to be used. Therefore, the maximum expected pressure inside the bags, that will be filled during the Ascent Phase, will be 1.6 psi/0.11 bar\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{/110 hPa}\DIFaddend . The inverse is also true for the Descent Phase where compression will occur. As such, the sampling bags should be fully filled during the Descent Phase in order to ensure that enough samples are collected for analysis. During the Descent Phase, the maximum pressure inside the bags is expected to be 1.98 psi/0.13 bar\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{/130 hPa}\DIFaddend . Past research has revealed that the selected sampling bags can withstand pressure difference of 310 hPa at 30 km of altitude, which is equivalent to 0.31 bar \cite{LISA}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A series of tests listed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Test 16 and 18, shown }\DIFaddend in Table \ref{tab:sampling-system-test} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{respective Table \ref{tab:pump-low-pressure-test},  }\DIFaddend will be conducted in order to confirm the maximum allowable pressure for the bags.

The maximum operating pressure for the tubes, according to the manufacturers, is 2.2 psi/0.15 bar\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{/150 hPa}\DIFaddend . The valve's leakage rate, given by the manufacturers, is 0.001 l/min.     


Due to the difference in pressure between sea level and sampling altitudes, the volume of the sample taken will be considerably reduced when it reaches sea level. This shrinking has to be taken into account as the minimum volume that has to be present in the sampling bag at \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ground }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sea }\DIFaddend level in order to obtain results with the Picarro analyzer. A minimum amount is required for the analyzer to detect concentrations of the targeted trace gases. This minimum amount is 0.18 L at sea level and it has to be specially considered for the samples taken at higher altitudes. The samples taken at lower altitudes will be exposed to smaller changes in pressure, therefore their size will not be critically reduced. Table \ref{tab:minimum-volume} shows the minimum volume of air that needs to be sampled at different altitudes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and the corresponding temperature and pressure conditions, in order the sample volume }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in order to assure the minimum air sample of 0.18L }\DIFaddend left at sea level\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{pressure and temperature (288 K)  is at least 0.18}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. }\\

\DIFadd{This is the worst case scenario, and testing has shown that the higher the volume of the air sample left at sea level, the better the results. This is why the aimed volume of the samples, at sea level will be at least 0.6}\DIFaddend L.

% Depending on the sampling altitude,there is a minimum volume of air that needs to be sampled in order the sample volume left at sea level pressure is at least 0.18 L. A sample volume of 0.18 L corresponds to the minimum amount required for the Picarro analyzer to detect concentrations of the targeted trace gases.

The AAC will need an air pump for sampling due to low ambient pressure at stratospheric altitudes. The air pump is also needed in order to assure the intake flow rate and obtain a good resolution. An air pump with an intake rate of at least 3 L/min will be used to ensure that the vertical resolution of the sampling air remains under 500 m during the Ascent Phase's ascent speed of 5 m/s and the  Descent Phase's descent speed of 8 m/s. A flushing valve (see Figure \ref{pneumatic_system}, No.23) will be used to flush the AAC system before each bag is filled and make sure that each bag will be filled with fresh air from the corresponding altitude. This filling/flushing procedure occurs twice, the first time during the Ascent Phase for the first two sampling bags and the second time during the Descent Phase for the remaining four sampling bags.

Shortly after the launch, the CAC valve will be opened in order to allow the fill gas that is inside the tube to flush, while the AAC valves will be closed until reaching the sampling altitude. Flushing of the CAC tube happens passively through the progressive decrease in air pressure during the balloon's Ascent Phase and it will be emptied by the time it reaches the Float Phase. Filling of the CAC tube also happens passively through the progressive increase in air pressure during the balloon's Descent Phase. The CAC valve will remain open at all time during the Ascent, Float, and Descent phases. The valve will close just before hitting the ground in order to preserve the sample. 

The ambient pressure will be measured by three pressure sensors located outside the experiment box. Only one of them is necessary for AAC and CAC, but using three will provide redundancy. To measure the pressure inside the bag that is currently being filled, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{three more sensors will be allocated inside the sensors box}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{one analogue static pressure sensor will be connected to the pneumatic system}\DIFaddend . To measure the ambient temperature in the CAC, three sensors will be allocated in the CAC box (in the Styrofoam). Temperature inside the coil is assumed to quickly adjust to the ambient temperature inside the CAC box, therefore there will not be differentiation in temperature between the air inside the tube and the air surrounding the tube. For the bags three more temperature sensors will be placed in the bags' box (in the Styrofoam). To control the temperature for the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Arduino, the }\DIFdelend pump and the valves in pneumatic subsystem, one temperature sensor will be used for each of them. In total, there will be \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{six }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{three }\DIFaddend pressure sensors and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{nine }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{eight }\DIFaddend temperature sensors. 

The sampling of the AAC will be triggered by the pressure reading from the sensors outside the experiment box. When the required pressure is reached, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as seen in }\DIFaddend Table \ref{tab:minimum-volume} the valve inside the manifold corresponding to the bag that is to be sampled, will open and the sampling will start. The closing of the valve depends on two conditions and it will be triggered when either one of the conditions is true. These conditions are: maximum sampling time or maximum pressure difference between inside/outside the bags. They are determined from past research \cite{LISA}. A first estimation of the maximum sampling time has already been made, from Test 18 shown in Table \ref{tab:pump-low-pressure-test}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, but more testsin the future will determine the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. Completed tests, such as Test 14 and Test 18, shown in Table \ref{tab:vacuum-test} respective Table \ref{tab:pump-low-pressure-test}, the }\DIFaddend maximum pressure condition \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and confirm }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{has been determined and }\DIFaddend the maximum sampling times \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have been confirmed}\DIFaddend .

The CAC emptying as well as the AAC and CAC sampling sequence is represented in Figures \ref{fig:ascent} and \ref{fig:descent}. It should be kept in mind that the different pressures are what triggers the opening of the valves.

\caption{Summary of Gondola-AAC-CAC Interfaces Components.}
\label{table:attaching-components}
\end{table}


\underline{Gondola - TUBULAR joining}

\smallskip
The experiment box will be fixed to the gondola rails by means of $10$ brackets interfacing the experiment outside structure with the hammer nuts in the rails. Two different types of brackets are used to be flexible with respect to the gondola rails distances, which can be modified by use after previous BEXUS campaigns. Eight small $20/20$ brackets (Figure \ref{fig:bracket_small}) are used to fix the AAC box to specific rails placement, and two other big brackets (Figure \ref{fig:bracket_big}) are used to fix the CAC box to the nearest rail. This method is secure as well as fast enough to provide an accessible and easy recovery for later analysis.

    \caption{Bracket Components.}
    \label{fig:bracket}
\end{figure}

\bigskip
\underline{CAC - AAC joining}

\smallskip
A simple but reliable fixing interface between the two boxes of the experiment has been designed to ensure the fast recovery of the CAC box. The latter requires only unscrewing 12 bolts as well as unplugging a D-Sub connector \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{marked in RED, see Figure \ref{fig:electrical_interfaces}}\DIFaddend . Once the CAC box is detached, the AAC Box will still remain perfectly fixed in the gondola. Table \ref{table:attaching-components} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{gathers up }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{includes }\DIFaddend all the components required to fix the experiment to the gondola.

\bigskip
\underline{Handles}

\smallskip
Four top handles, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:handles} will be mounted to facilitate the experiment box manipulation when moving it in and out of the gondola.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

\bigskip
\underline{Inlet/Outlet Pipes}
\label{subsec:pipes}

\smallskip
In order to collect reliable air samples, the experiment requires to be mounted \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{at least with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with at least }\DIFaddend one side exposed to the outside. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The later }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This }\DIFaddend will reduce the pipe length used to collect clean air. As it can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:3D_tubular_render}, three pipes will extend from the experiment box face: one for the CAC sampling and two, input and output, for the AAC sampling. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The one-way selected method will provide a proper flushing of the pipe and thus ensure a reliable sampling as explained in Section \ref{Experiment_Setup}.
}\DIFdelend 

These pipes are welded/drawn $304$ grade stainless steel tubes from RESTEK company, which are specially recommended for chromatography applications and gas delivery systems with low pressures and inert environments. These tubes are sulfinert, which is a required treatment for metal components when analyzing for parts-per-billion levels of organo-sulfur compounds.

The tubes, which are the same that will be used in the pneumatic system of the \emph{Brain} (see Section \ref{sec:4.4.5}), have an outer diameter $OD = 6.35\ mm$ ($1/4$ inches) and an inner diameter $ID = 4.57\ mm$ ($0.18$ inches).

\DIFaddbegin \bigskip
\underline{\DIFadd{Pump vibration}}
\label{subsec:vibration}

\DIFadd{To mitigate the vibrations produced by the pump, an extra piece of styrofoam has been added between the pump's anchor plate and the surface of the level 1 of the brain, where this key component is fixed. 
}


\DIFaddend \subsubsection{Thermal Interfaces}
\label{sec:4.2.2}

Both main structural components and external walls of the two boxes of the experiment are made by aluminum and steel components. For this reason, since these are conductive materials, a direct attachment to the gondola creates many heat paths with the internal space and subsystems of the experiment. Considering that the temperature gradient between the gondola and the operative requirements of the electronic components can be quite high, this conductive connections drastically decrease the efficiency of the thermal insulation. Therefore, a system based on rubber bumpers and styrofoam bars (see Figure \ref{fig:thermal_interface}) has been designed to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{add }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{remove }\DIFaddend heat bridges and minimize temperature leaks from the inside of the experiment to the outside.

Figure \ref{fig:rubber_bumper} shows a CAD model of the bumper component and how it looks like when attached to the gondola with the brackets explained in the previous section.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{CAC Interfaces}
An uncoupled quick connector, shown in Figure \ref{fig:Quick-connector-body}, will be attached at each end of the coiled tube to seal the opening. It will remain tightly sealed until the quick connectors are manually coupled. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

The interfaces between the other parts in the CAC set up will be joined with specific tube fittings, listed in Table \ref{tab:CAC-interfaces}. All the chosen interfaces are from Swagelok. Using products from the same manufacture \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{minimize }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{minimizes }\DIFaddend the risk for leakage or mismatched interfaces in the system.

\subsubsection{Electrical Interfaces}
\label{sec:4.2.3}

The experiment will connect to the gondola electrically via a 4 pin, male, box mount receptacle MIL - C-26482P series 1 connector with an 8-4 insert arrangement (MS3112E8-4P) \cite{BexusManual}. It will connect to one 28.8 V/1 mA battery pack which consists of eight SAFT LSH20 batteries in series where each has a 5 A fuse\cite{BexusManual}. The expected maximum current is 1.1 A.

    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{4-experiment-design/img/connectors.png}
    \caption{Connectors.}
    \label{fig:connectors}
\end{figure}

The E-Link connection shall be made between the experiment and the E-Link system using a RJ45 connection which will be supplied by SSC and an Ethernet protocol. The Amphenol RJF21B connector will be mounted on either the front or the side of the experiment\cite{BexusManual}.  

The CAC and AAC will be connected together with a D-SUB 9-pin connector where power, ground and signals for the sensors in the CAC will be connected. A female connector will be located on the AAC wall and a male connector on the CAC wall.

Another female D-SUB 9-pin connector will be located on the wall of the AAC in which the connections for the three ambient pressure sensors will be located. Connectors with different pin configuration are shown in Figure \ref{fig:connectors}.

The expected data rate is 1.58 kbits/s for downlink and 1.08 kbits/s for uplink.

\subsection{Mechanical Design} \label{Mechanical_Design}
\DIFaddbegin \label{sec:mechanical-design}
\DIFaddend 

The experiment consists of two rectangular boxes, one stacked next to the other, shown in Figure \ref{dimensions}. The higher but narrower box (CAC box) allocates the heaviest element, the CAC. The main box (AAC box) contains the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{AAC }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pneumatic }\DIFaddend system with six sampling bags \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, as well as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend the central command unit: The Brain. The Brain contains the general Electronic box (EB) as well as the pneumatic sampling system.

The two-box design will allow ease of access and manipulation of both the CAC and AAC subsystems. In addition, the AAC sampling system is designed to be re-usable for future handover to the FMI, as such, it will be mountable on any standard balloon flight without having to introduce major design changes. If a battery as a power unit \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{where }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend introduced, hence less bags could be carried (around five bags) in this potential future setup, see Figure \ref{battery_distribution}.

\smallskip
Since the CAC will be the heaviest component in the whole experiment its positioning and orientation inside the gondola will directly affect the stress analysis of the structure. In the worst case scenario, without a proper study of the aforesaid interface, shear in the screws could be produced after a violent landing stress or unexpected shaking.

\subsubsection{Structure}
\label{sec:4.4.1}

The main purpose of an experiment box structure is to provide overall mechanical integrity and maintain the system geometry. It \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{shall be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend able to carry the loads of all the phases of the flight and ensure that all the components and subsystems can withstand them. Test 9 in Table \ref{tab:vibration-test} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will help }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{helped }\DIFaddend to confirm the frame can withstand these vibrations\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and updates to the design will be made if necessary}\DIFdelend .

Moreover, other considerations such as electrical and, especially, thermal conductivity are also \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{be }\DIFdelend a concern since the experiment will fly up to $25\ km$ in the Polar Circle in \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{mid }\DIFaddend October and many critical subsystems have tight operative ranges values.

\subsubsection{Walls and Protections}
\label{sec:4.4.2}

Since the experiment will be placed close to the outside of the gondola, it is very exposed to both external elements impacts and also possible broken parts from other experiments in the gondola due to unexpected rapid movements, and a probable hard landing impact. Therefore, the experiment box \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend shielded with removable aluminum walls along with a thick layer of Styrofoam attached to each wall. This thickness varies from two to three centimeters in the AAC box, and five \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{centimiters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{centimeters }\DIFaddend to protect the AirCore. Besides protection, the thickness of the styrofoam is also motivated by thermal control issues.
% which is explained more in detail in Section \ref{sec:4.6.6}.

To mount the experiment a combination of three different elements \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are }\DIFaddend used, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:wall_attach}. The walls \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are }\DIFaddend screwed to the Variofix blocks by means of $M4\times8$ bolts. In between the aluminum walls and the bolts, a $M4$ retainer ring \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{has been }\DIFaddend placed to improve the fixation of each spot. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Four }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Eight }\DIFaddend fixation points for each wall have been considered sufficient to keep the experiment safe from any impact.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{However, double the amount of fixation points, eight, will be used in the more exposed walls that are facing outside the gondola.
}\DIFdelend 

The styrofoam sheets \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are }\DIFaddend attached to the aluminum walls with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{polyamide washers screwed along both layers}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{double sided tape}\DIFaddend .

The CAC subsystem is designed to fit a $300$ m stainless steel coiled tube, a solenoid valve \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{provided by SMC }\DIFaddend controlling it, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{interfaces}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tube fittings manufactured by Swagelok}\DIFaddend , an air filter and three temperature sensors. A schematic of this subsystem can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:CAC-schematic}. The CAC consists of a combination of a $200$ m coiled tube of $1/8$ inches diameter and a $100$ m coiled tube of $1/4$ inches diameter. The outlet of the CAC is sealed with a quick connector provided by FMI. The inlet \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend sealed the same way but it \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{can }\DIFaddend be opened by another interface plugged into the quick connector. A \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{filter }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{custom made filter by FMI }\DIFaddend is placed between this orifice and the solenoid valve.

%The AAC Subsystem consists of six $3\ L$ sampling bags. Each bag will have a dedicated valve in the Valve Center (VC) to allow emptying and filling processes as well as to close the bag when needed. The bags will be placed vertically and will have two anchor points: on the top through a  multiple anchor interface (see Figure \ref{anchor_bags}) and on the bottom by means of the tubes connecting them to the valves.

\DIFaddend \underline{The Brain}
\label{subsec:brain}

\smallskip
The Brain is an essential part of the experiment. It is a three-level structure containing both the pneumatic system and the electronics of the experiment, seen in Figure \ref{brain_isometric_open}. Its design aimed to make it compact enough to both allow a proper thermal control and to fit into the space left next to the sampling bags. It is placed in a corner of the AAC box. Therefore, The Brain takes advantage of the vertical space inside the AAC box. It has three different levels: Level 1 - Pump, Level 2 - Valve Center\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend and Level 3 - Electronics.


\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
Level 1 of The Brain is lying on the base wall styrofoam. It contains the beginning of the pneumatic sampling system. The inlet tube passes through the wall and interfaces with the filter. From here the system continues through the pump \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, airflow sensor }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{provided by KNF, }\DIFaddend and to Level 2. The reason for having the pump in Level 1 is to have the minimum vibration transmitted to the other components. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The pump will have }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{As explained in section \ref{subsec:vibration}, a piece of styrofoam has been added between the pump and the level 1 plate to help mitigate its vibrations. The pump has }\DIFaddend two heaters close by that will be used to regulate its temperature. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This can be seen as two black rectangular sheets underneath the pump in Figure \ref{level_1}.
}\DIFdelend %DIF > This can be seen as two black rectangular sheets underneath the pump in Figure \ref{level_1}.

The second level of The Brain is responsible for the distribution of the air to the selected sampling bag. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{From Level 1, the air passes through the airflow sensor and the static pressure sensor that allow for monitoring the behavior of the system. }\DIFaddend The manifold with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{8 solenoid valves}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{six solenoid valves, manufactured by SMC, }\DIFaddend is the main component. From here, the tubes connect with the bags. A T-Union connection is used just before the bag valve. This interface allows the pre-flight flushing of the tubes connecting with the valves as explained previously. 

\smallskip
The flushing valve is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend responsible to ensure a proper flushing of the system before each sampling period. From the flushing valve, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a outlet tube (in red) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an outlet tube }\DIFaddend reaches the outside environment. This can be seen in Figure \ref{level_2}.

The OBC and its external elements \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are }\DIFaddend allocated in the third level of The Brain. The PCB \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend fixed to the aluminum plate by means of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{5 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{10 }\DIFaddend standoffs. As shown in Figure \ref{level_3}, it has a hole, as well as the level plate, to collect all the wires connecting with levels 1 and 2. This level has its own outside \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{top }\DIFaddend wall which contains the electrical interfaces. The latter allows \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to open the wall }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the wall to be opened }\DIFaddend without having to remove all the sockets attached with screws and a female in the inside of the wall. The styrofoam shielding of The Brain has a hole \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{at this height }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on top }\DIFaddend to allow the temperature sensors wires to reach the inside of the AAC Box. 

A more detailed content of the components for each level is summarized in Appendix \ref{list-of-components-brain}.

The bulk dimensions of The Brain are 260 mm long, 150mm wide and 290 mm high. If the shielding styrofoam walls are taken into account, the dimensions are 290 mm long, 180 mm wide and 300 mm high.
Therefore, accounting for the space the column bars take, each plate has a surface of 258 mm x 158 mm. The distance between levels is variable depending on the components dimensions. Level 1 has a height if 7 cm, Level 2 has a height of 9 cm and Level 3 has 8 cm to the top styrofoam shielding. The Brain with styrofoam shielding can be seen in Figure \ref{brain_isometric}.

The most critical components in terms of required thermal control are inside The Brain. These are the pump and the valves. In order to provide a passive thermal shielding, 3 cm thick removable styrofoam walls are placed in the three walls (top\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and laterals}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, lateral, and rear}\DIFaddend ) facing the interior of the AAC box, shown in Figure \ref{brain_isometric}.

The larger lateral wall, where the tubes from the valves are, is divided in two pieces so it can be removed without having to disconnect the tubes.

\DIFaddend \subsubsection{Pneumatic Subsystem}
\label{sec:4.4.5}

In order to be able to collect separated samples of air, a pneumatic subsystem has been developed \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and implemented}\DIFaddend . The schematics and components of this can be seen in Figure \ref{pneumatic_system}. The system is formed by almost $100$ components located inside The Brain and the AAC Box. 

In between these components, the same Sulfinert-treated stainless steel tubing as the ones used for the Inlet/Outlet pipes explained in Section \ref{subsec:pipes} have been chosen. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{According to the datasheet, the minimum suggested bend radius for the chosen diameter tube is \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFdelend %DIF > According to the datasheet, the minimum suggested bend radius for the chosen diameter tube is $10.2\ cm$. Any bend sharper than this may cause the tubing to stretch, potentially creating active sites as the coating layer density decreases. For this reason, $90^\circ$ elbow interfaces have been used instead of the previously considered straight ones,  to perform all the required sharp curves to allocate all the components inside the volume-limited \emph{Brain}.

The schematic for the pneumatic system can be seen in Figure \ref{pneumatic_system}. The air is sucked from the outside through the inlet tube (No.1), \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{turquoise }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the lower tube }\DIFaddend in Figure \ref{pneumatic_system_cad}, and it goes through the filter (No\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.3}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.2}\DIFaddend ) inside the pump (No\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.7}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.9}\DIFaddend ). From here, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and changing to Level 2, }\DIFaddend it passes through the airflow sensor (No\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.11}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.15}\DIFaddend ), which allows \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to monitor the flow rate , before changing to Level 2. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the airflow rate to be monitored. }\DIFaddend Thereafter the air passes through the static pressure sensor (No\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.15}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.20}\DIFaddend ) before getting to the six \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{stations }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{station }\DIFaddend manifold (No\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.19}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.23}\DIFaddend ). It is in here where the air is directed to the desired bag (No\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.31}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.36}\DIFaddend ) thanks to its dedicated solenoid valve (No\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.26}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.30}\DIFaddend ).

When flushing the pneumatic system before each sampling period, the flushing valve (No\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.23}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.27}\DIFaddend ) is opened so that the outlet of the system is open and new air runs through the main part of the pneumatic system.

\label{sec:4.5.1}

The electronics design can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:electronics-block-diagram} which shows the connections, grounding, voltages, and signals.

Most of the electronics \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are }\DIFaddend located in the Brain inside the AAC box. However, there \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are }\DIFaddend six distinct areas:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Brain level 3, where the PCB is located with the Arudino and shield, two 24 V DC-DC, two 12 V DC-DC, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{one temperature sensor, }\DIFdelend 11 MOSFETs and 16 LEDs.
    \item The Brain level 2, where the valve manifolds with six sampling valves, the flushing valve, two heaters\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, airflow sensor, static pressure sensor }\DIFaddend and one temperature sensor are located.
    \item The Brain level 1, where the pump, two heaters \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, airflow sensor, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend one temperature sensor \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and static pressure sensor }\DIFdelend are located.
    \item The AAC box, where 3 ambient temperature sensors are located.
    \item The CAC box, where the CAC valve and 3 ambient temperature sensors are located.
    \item Outside of the experiment box, where 3 ambient pressure sensors are located.
\end{enumerate}

From the PCB, on level 3, five D-sub connectors \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have been }\DIFaddend used to connect to the other five areas. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A 25 pin connector will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Fifteen pin connectors have been }\DIFaddend used for level 1 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, 15 pin connector will be used for level 2 and nine pin connectors will be used for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and level 2. For }\DIFaddend the CAC box, AAC box sampling bags area, and the external pressure sensors\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, nine pin connectors have been used}\DIFaddend . In addition there \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend a connection to the gondola power and gondola E-link.

All of the power distribution \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will take place on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{has been done through }\DIFaddend the PCB using two 24 V DC-DC and two 12 V DC-DC converters in parallel with a forwarding diode.  
\begin{itemize}
  \item $28.8 \, V \Longrightarrow 24 \, V $ By DC-DC converters
  \item $28.8 \, V \Longrightarrow 12 \, V$ By DC-DC converters
  \end{itemize}
The heaters \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{do }\DIFaddend not require the voltage to be stepped down and so will be powered directly from the gondola battery.

The Arduino will control all of the sensors, valves, heaters and the pump from the PCB. Sensors \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have been }\DIFaddend directly connected to the Arduino. The valves, heaters and the pump \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have been }\DIFaddend connected via a switching circuit.

The LEDs are used as visual indicators that display whether different parts of the circuit are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{alive }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{active }\DIFaddend or not. They give indications on the status of the valves, pump, heaters, DC-DC converters and Arduino. 

Grounding \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be following }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{has been done to follow }\DIFaddend a distributed single point grounding, with all ground connections meeting at a single star point to ensure there are no floating grounds. As not all components are connected via DC-DC converters the experiment will not be isolated from the gondola power supply therefore there will be a connection between the star point and the gondola ground. The star point \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend located on the main PCB board which \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will then  be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is then  }\DIFaddend grounded to the experiment box. The grounding can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:electronics-block-diagram} where it is indicated by dashed lines labeled GND. The analog sensors that are used on level 1 in the brain use a separate grounding wire(AGND) onto the main PCB where there is a separate trace connecting to the ground pins on the Arduino board. Furthermore  the  upper  and  lower  level  of  the  main PCB board \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will make use of one }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are making use of the }\DIFaddend common grounding plane \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{where possible}\DIFaddend .

\subsubsection{Miniature Diaphragm Air Pump}
The pump which has been selected is the 850.1.2. KNDC B, Figure \ref{fig:pumppic}, which is manufactured by KNF. One of the reasons this pump has been selected is that it has successfully been flown on a similar flight in the past where it managed to pump enough air at 25 km altitude to have 180 mL remaining at sea level \cite{LISA}. However, to ensure the pump will operate as intended, several tests will still be carried out. These tests --- 4, 5, 18, 28 and 29, can be seen in Tables \ref{tab:vacuum-test}, \ref{tab:thermal-test}, \ref{tab:pump-low-pressure-test}, \ref{tab:pump-operation-test}, and \ref{tab:pump-current-pressure-test}. The pump has already passed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{three }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{four }\DIFaddend of these tests and their results can be seen in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Section }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Appendix }\DIFaddend \ref{sec:test28result} for Test 28, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Section }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Appendix \ref{sec:test4results} for test 4, Appendix }\DIFaddend \ref{subsection:pumplowpressuretest} for Test 18 and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Section }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Appendix }\DIFaddend \ref{sec:test29result} for Test 29.

At sea level conditions the pump was tested and found to have a flow rate of 8.0 L/min and a current draw of 250 mA. The peak current draw was recorded as 600 mA which lasts for less than one second and occurs when the pump is switched on. 

From the results of Test 18, in Section \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{subsection:pumplowpressuretest}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{sec:ExpecterResults}}\DIFaddend , the flow rate is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{estimated to be 3.0 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{shown to be around 3.36 }\DIFaddend L/min at the lowest pressure that will be seen in flight. This is in line with requirement D23. The results found in Test 28, in Section \ref{sec:test28result}, appear to be inline with the information given by the manufacturer, seen in Figure \ref{fig:pumpflowcur}.  The highest continuous current draw expected from the pump is 185 mA when the experiment is at 12 km altitude and is expected to decrease as we increase in altitude. While it appears the pump increases in current draw at around 6 km there is no plan to sample below 12 km therefore the highest current draw can be taken from 12 km. As the pump has a peak current of 600 mA when it switches on, the mosfet and DC-DC power have been chosen to be able to withstand this demand.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Electromagnetically Controlled Valves}
Filling the sampling bags will be controlled by solenoid valves. The solenoid valves which have been selected are model VDW23-5G-1-H-Q, seen in Figure \ref{fig:valve}, manufactured by SMC. These valves will be normally closed through out the experiment with zero power consumption and will open, when given power, to fill up the sampling bags at specific altitudes. In addition one valve \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend on the CAC, in order to seal the coil at the end of the flight and another at the end of the AAC tubing, flushing valve, in order to flush the system.  The valves selected for these are model VDW22UANXB, Figure \ref{fig:valve}. The CAC valve will be opened shortly after take off and remain open the whole flight. This valve will be closed shortly before landing. The flushing valve will be opened before sampling in order to ensure the air in the tubes is from the correct altitude.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{align*}
        \includegraphics[width=6cm]{4-experiment-design/img/valves.png}

    \caption{SMC Solenoid Valves, VDW22UANXB on the Left, VDW23-5G-1-H-Q on the Right.}
    \label{fig:valve}
\end{figure}

The port size of the valves is 1/8" which is compatible with the gas analyzer. The coil inside can withstand temperatures from -20 to 50 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Â°C }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$\degree{C}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend which is suitable for flight operations at high altitudes. These valves can operate under a maximum pressure drop of 133 Pa. Valves from the same series have been flown before to the stratosphere and provided successful results \cite{LISA} however, the valves \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have been }\DIFaddend tested at low temperature and pressure to check they still operate as intended. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{These planned tests }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The test results }\DIFaddend can be seen in Test 4, Table \ref{tab:vacuum-test} and Test 5, Table \ref{tab:thermal-test}.

\subsubsection{Switching Circuits}
The valves, pump and heaters \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will not be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are not }\DIFaddend powered by the Arduino but they \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{still need to be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are still }\DIFaddend controlled by it.In order to allow this control a connection will be made for each component to the Arduino with a switching circuit. This switching circuit \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will use a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{uses }\DIFaddend eleven MOSFETs, model IRLB8748PBF, Figure \ref{fig:mosfet}, to control which components are turned on at which time.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{align*}
        \includegraphics[width=10cm]{4-experiment-design/img/mosfet.png}
    \end{align*}
    \caption{Figure Showing an Image of the 30V,78A,75W MOSFET, Model Number IRLB8748PBF on the Left and the Schematic for the Switching Circuit for One Heater on the Right.}\label{fig:mosfet}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Schematic}

The schematics show all the components and how they are connected, the full schematics can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:Schematic}. There are four requirements for the the power distribution given below:

\begin{itemize}

    \item $28.8 \, V$ for the heaters.  

    \item $28.8 \, V \Longrightarrow 24 \, V$ for the pump and valves.

    \item $28.8 \, V \Longrightarrow 12 \, V$ for the airflow sensor, static pressure sensor and Arduino due.

    \item $3.3 \, V$ for the temperature and pressure sensors. 

\end{itemize}

The voltage available from gondola power is 28.8 V, therefore the heaters have been connected directly to the main power supply. For the rest of the components, two 24 V and two 12 V DC-DCs in parallel has been used to make sure if one of them fails then the other can take over. The circuitry can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:dc-dc-redun}. All the valves and the pump are then powered through the 24 V DC-DCs. To step down the voltage from 28.8 V to 12 V to power the airflow sensor, static pressure sensor and the Arduino, two 12 V DC-DCs in parallel \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{has }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have }\DIFaddend been used for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend redundancy purposes. Finally, to power the temperature and external pressure sensors, 3.3 V is required which is supplied by the Arduino board. 

To meet the requirements of the pneumatic subsystem, a static pressure sensor has been chosen to measure the pressure inside the tubes and bags. This analogue pressure sensor operates on 12 V so can share the same power line as the airflow sensor and Arduino.

\subsubsection{PCB Layout}

All electronic control circuits \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are }\DIFaddend gathered on a single PCB on level 3 of the Brain. The PCB contains the Arduino due, switching circuits, indication LEDs, a temperature sensor, the power system and all necessary connectors. The connectors have been divided so that each connector's wires goes to the same level of the Brain to improve cable management. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Due to the relocation of components there are some components on level 2, Static pressure sensor and the airflow sensor, which are connected to the level 1 connector. Although this did not produce major problems since both those components have separate connectors on the cable going down to level 1 and does not share any connections with any components on level 1. Thus you can still unplug each level separately since the wires to these two components could just be broken of from the cable loom at the appropriate point. }\DIFaddend To further improve cable management the shared pins for I2C and SPI \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have been }\DIFaddend connected to a single pin on each respective D-SUB connector and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{should be }\DIFdelend split up on the respective level.

\subsection{Thermal Design} \label{Thermal_section}

\subsubsection{Thermal Environment}
\begin{centering}
The experiment will experience wide temperature fluctuations during the flight and it must be able to continue to operate despite these changes. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:temperature-profile} the coldest point of the flight will be between 10 km and 15 km where the air temperature can drop to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$-70\degree$
}%DIFAUXCMD
C }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$-70\degree{C}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend outside. Past flights have recorded temperatures on the gondola as low as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$-55\degree$
}%DIFAUXCMD
C }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$-55\degree{C}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend during the Ascent and Descent Phases\cite{BexusManual}. Sampling with the AAC will begin when the balloon has risen to 18 km during the Ascent Phase and will last until the Float Phase. Sampling will resume when the gondola has fallen to 17.5 km during the Descent Phase. This means the experiment will be above the coldest part of the atmosphere and the critical components will have time to achieve their operating temperature before sampling time commences. In addition, launching from Kiruna in late October means the temperature on the ground could be as low as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$-10\degree$
}%DIFAUXCMD
C}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$-10\degree{C}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . 
As the component with the highest lower limit operating temperature must be at a minimum of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$5\degree$
}%DIFAUXCMD
C }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$5\degree{C}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend (E3 in Table \ref{tab:thermal-table}), heating may need to be switched on while the experiment is still on the ground.
\end{centering}

    \end{align*}
    \caption{Diagram Showing the Temperature Profile of the Atmosphere \cite{jacob}.}\label{fig:temperature-profile}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The Critical Stages}
The flight will have the following critical stages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Launch pad
    \item Early ascent
    \item Sampling ascent
    \item Float
    \item Descent before sampling
    \item Sampling descent
    \item Shut down
    \item Landed, waiting for recovery
\end{itemize}
These stages have been accounted for in further calculations and simulations.

\subsubsection{Overall Design}
To protect the components against the cold, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{thermal protection will need to be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a thermal control system has been }\DIFaddend designed. Insulation and internal heating will both come into play in keeping all the components functional throughout the duration of the flight. The two components with the most critical thermal ranges are the pump and the valve manifold system (E3 and E5 in Table \ref{tab:thermal-table}). Thermal regulation \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend mainly focused on the AAC\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{however, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, however }\DIFaddend a thermal analysis of the CAC can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:appI} under Section \ref{sssec:CAC-trial-flight} where the  CAC box the valve is identified as the critical component in terms of thermal regulation (refer to component E5 in Table \ref{tab:thermal-table}). It will have a current through it throughout the flight\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend heating it self up.

% New for the SED v2
The main protection against the cold environment in the stratosphere \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend a passive thermal design by means of  insulating layers added to the walls of the experiment. It will be comprised of two layers: one outer sheet of aluminum and a thicker sheet of Styrofoam. The main insulating factor is Styrofoam which will significantly reduce the heat exchange between the otherwise exposed experiment box, and will also provide shock absorption when the gondola lands after separating from the balloon.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Highlight of the Heater On the Pump.}
    \label{fig:highlight-heater-on-pump}
\end{figure}

An active thermal control system \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will also be included }\DIFdelend consisting of four heaters \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{has also been included}\DIFaddend . Two heaters will regulate the pump's temperature as seen in Figure \ref{fig:highlight-heater-on-pump} and a single heater will regulate the flushing valve temperature and one heater for the manifold. To control these heaters, two temperature sensors \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will also be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are also }\DIFaddend on board in close proximity to the heaters. If the reading from one of the temperature sensors is lower than the predefined threshold, then the heater will turn on to warm up the cooling component. If it is above the higher threshold the heater will turn off.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Simulation }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Simulations }\DIFaddend in MATLAB (code can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:appJ}) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{where }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were }\DIFaddend used to determine the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{average }\DIFaddend uniform heat inside the experiment. The ANSYS thermal modelling platform was used to the simulate the thermal conditions inside the Brain.

Table {\ref{tab:thermal-table}}, below, covers the thermal ranges of the components \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{crucial to the experiment flight from those }\DIFaddend listed in Section \ref{sec:experiment-components}:

\input{4-experiment-design/tables/thermaltable1-highlight-4-0.tex}

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A complete table of component temperature ranges, which includes static entities (such as wires and connectors) can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:appI}.
}

\DIFaddend \subsubsection{Internal Temperature}
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{As the current experiment model stands, an enclosed partition has been }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{An enclosed partition of the experiment model was }\DIFaddend reserved in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{lower front left-hand }\DIFdelend corner of the AAC section\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of the experiment}\DIFdelend . This partition \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{took the shape of a rectangular section and was to }\DIFaddend house all of the electronic components not required to be situated in specified locations throughout the experiment setting, such as \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the Arduino boards and }\DIFaddend some of the sensors.

The pump has the most critical temperature range as it is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a single point of failure component }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the only component in the experiment }\DIFaddend that cannot operate below freezing temperatures. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Failure of the pump will mean failure of the AAC system. }\DIFaddend It's data sheet states that it must always operate above \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$5\degree$
}%DIFAUXCMD
C}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$5\degree{C}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , or the EPDM diaphragm may not be able to expand and contract sufficiently to maintain the desired airflow of 8 L/min. However, as this pump has been used successfully on previous high altitude flights, \cite{LISA}, tests \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were }\DIFaddend conducted on the pump to find its true performance at lower temperatures and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in a }\DIFaddend low vacuum environment. The AAC valves are also crucial to the experiment's function, as they enable each and every sampling bag on board to be used. For this reason, while the valves can operate down to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$-20\degree$
}%DIFAUXCMD
C}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$-20\degree{C}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , it is desirable to be keep them above this limit whenever in use. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The manifold valves in the brain have a minimum operating temperature of only \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$-10\degree{C}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
, but simulations have proven they will be kept above \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$0\degree{C}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
.
}\DIFaddend 

As the most temperature-sensitive equipment will all be housed within the Brain, it is important to know what heat will be lost through the different heat transfer mechanisms as this will affect the amount of time the heaters will need to be active. This has been addressed through calculations and simulations to find required insulation. All calculations concerning heat transfer can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:appI}. As a worst-case scenario for heat distribution, it is assumed that \textit{all} of the power dissipated through resistance in the electrical components will reach the marked boundaries of the experiment's walls.

Aluminum sheeting will be used as the outer layer of insulation for the experiment and Styrofoam brand foam will be used as the inner layer. Aluminum may have among the highest of thermal conductivities, but its arrangement around the Styrofoam, creating one large heat bridge with the inner layer, would provide a useful thermoregulatory mechanism \cite{EngTool}. The high ratio between the absorptivity (0.3) and emissivity (0.09) of the material may be used to its advantage \cite{EngTool}. Because the ratio for polished aluminum is higher than 1.0, the element will get hotter as it gets exposed to the radiation from the sun and the power-dissipating components \cite{RedRok}. The low emissivity coefficient for the aluminum cover means it will not get significantly hotter than the surrounding ambient temperature, but its increased temperature may negate some of the heat being lost from the experiment's interior via some of the heat from the aluminum propagating into the experiment, reducing the net heat loss by a small amount. As conservation of power is imperative, the heaters should be used sparingly, and instead methods like the use of aluminum for shielding should be employed as passive heating. The aluminum layer will be 0.5 mm in thickness, while the Styrofoam layer beneath it would span 20 mm in thickness. The Styrofoam, in contrast to the aluminum has a low thermal conductivity even when compared to similar polymer structures \cite{EngTool}. The Styrofoam would handle the bulk of the thermal resistance in keeping the experiment from losing the heat it would have obtained prior to being moved to the launchpad. The aluminum would come into play as the experiment rises into colder altitudes and encounters increased sun exposure. While the warmed aluminum will have little impact on the experiment's heat loss, this also means that the experiment's internal temperatures will be prevented from rising to the upper allowed operating limit of the experiment made possible because of the aluminum's low absorptivity of sunlight.
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend Another heat bridge that is needed is the fastening of the experiment \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to }\DIFaddend the gondola. The aluminum frame of the gondola will be colder \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{then }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{than }\DIFaddend the experiment and with normal screws there will be a lot of heat transfer. In this case rubber bumper \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{screw}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{screws}\DIFaddend , suggested at CDR\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend will be used to fasten \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the experiment to the gondola }\DIFaddend and will reduce the heat transfer between the experiment and the gondola.


\subsubsection{Calculations and Simulation Reports}
\label{sec:4.6.5}

The temperature ranges can vary for the different stages but the most critical moment is during the Ascent Phase. While ascending, the main source of heat to maintain the pump and manifold's operating temperature is the heaters. During the Float and Descent Phases, heat originating from the sun will be enough to maintain these component's operational temperatures. According to the thermal analysis, the heaters would not be required during descent but there is power reserved in the worst case scenario that they need to be run during the Descent Phase.
All simulation equations and their details can be seen in Appendix \ref{sec:appI}. 

An estimate of the temperature in the Brain at the sampling times during the Ascent Phase is visualized in Figure \ref{fig:Air-in-brain-4-6}. The higher temperature is in the lower right corner where the pump is located. A cooler area exists around the middle of the left edge where no heaters are applied. The legend in the Figure shows the temperature in Celsius.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \label{fig:Air-in-brain-4-6}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:test-flight-AAC-4-6} the average temperature \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{off }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of }\DIFaddend the pump with data from ANSYS is presented. One is simulated with no air in the Brain and the other \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{have }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{has }\DIFaddend air with the same density as sea level. In between the vertical dotted line is when the experiment is above 15km. At 4h in the figure the experiment is launched. It can be seen that the pump will have an average temperature over 5 degrees during the flight.

The following two figures in Figure \ref{fig:Pump-Valve-ascent-sample-4-6} are a visualization of the pump and the manifold at the time in which the AAC sampling begins during ascent.

\end{figure}

During a worst case simulation that is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Pump-Valve-ascent-sample-4-6}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend the four heaters were used for 26.66 Wh in total together over the course of the simulation the figures are from. Only the pump heaters might require more time if it is colder outside and there is dedicated 80 Wh in the power budget table, Table \ref{tab:power-design-table}. So there is a margin to keep the pump heaters on for a longer time if needed.

Based on the calculations and thermal simulations, it can be concluded the thermal designed passive and active thermal control mechanisms detailed in this section will ensure that the AAC's pump and manifold will operate nominally during the entire flight flight. It has been concluded that the CAC has a sufficiently adequate thermal design to operate throughout the whole flight. 

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Thermal testing (Test 5, section \ref{Test-5}) shows that the heaters and the subsequent internal temperature responded as expected from simulations and work as required when heating the critical components. A full 4h test at \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\begin{centering}
The Gondola provides a 28.8 V, 374 Wh or 13 Ah battery with a recommended maximum \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{continuous }\DIFaddend current draw of 1.8 A . However, more typical values are 196 Wh or 7 Ah \cite{BexusManual}.The experiment must run on \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{external power for four }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(gondola) battery for two }\DIFaddend hours before launch during the countdown phase and for the entire flight duration, lasting approximately \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{four }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{six }\DIFaddend hours.

The estimated total power consumption \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{177 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{181 }\DIFaddend Wh, Table \ref{tab:power-design-table}, is within the limits of the available power.

\subsection{Software Design}
\subsubsection{Purpose}
The purpose of the software is to automate control of the valves so that they will be opened/closed at the target altitude. Moreover, the software will store housekeeping data from sensors, pump, and valves states to the on-board memory storage device. Logging sensor data is necessary in order to determine a vertical profile of the analyzed samples:

\begin{quote}
In order to determine the vertical profiles of CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and CO from the analysis of sampled air, measurements of several atmospheric parameters are needed [...]. The two most important parameters are the ambient pressure and the mean coil temperature. These parameters will be recorded by the AirCore-HR (High Resolution) electronic data package. Mean coil temperature is obtained by taking the mean of three temperatures recorded by independent probes located at different positions along the AirCore-HR.\cite{Membrive}
\end{quote}

Both the ambient pressure and the sampling container temperature are also essential for AAC sampling bags. The temperature data will be collected by the sensors near the sampling bags.

The software shall also transmit data to the ground so that the team can monitor the conditions of the experiment in real time. Telecommand is also needed to overwrite pre-programmed sampling scheduled in case of automation failure or to mitigate unexpected changes in the flight path and reached altitudes. It will also be used to test the system, especially valves and heaters.\par

The software which run on the Arduino reads from the sensors through the analog, I2C, and SPI interfaces. The sensors provides temperature, pressure and airflow data. The acquired data will be time-stamped and stored in the on-board SD card and transmitted via the E-Link System to the ground station. Then according to the pressure/altitude, the software controls the valves which will allow the air to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{flow inside the tube and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{be pumped inside the }\DIFaddend bags. Figure \ref{processOverview} visually explain the process flow.

\DIFdelend . Telecommands will also be used as backup in case the automation fails or otherwise become unresponsive. Telemetry will be utilized to transmit housekeeping data and the state of the valves to get confirmation of operation. Rigorous testing will be performed during the development of the project and before the launch phase to insure that that the software is capable to control the experiment.
\item{Interfaces}\\
Table \ref{tab:comIntpro} demonstrates how the components will interact with the onboard computer (OBC). Components that use SPI, will share MISO, MOSI, and CLK pins on the Arduino board. Each of them will also be connected to general pins input output (GPIO) for slave select. Furthermore, components using I2C protocol, will share Serial Data pin (SDA) and Serial Clock pin (SCL).

\label{tab:comIntpro}
\end{table}

Every transmission to/from the ground will utilize the E-link connection. The data packet which will be used is Ethernet Packet with a header contains the address of destination, followed by the data, and at the end there is a frame check sequence (FCS). The up-linked data packet will have the same structure, with header followed by commands and ended with FCS.\\
\\
The protocol that has been chosen are UDP for telemetry and TCP for telecommand. The UDP is used to prevent software getting stuck waiting for handshake from the ground if the connection is temporarily lost.\\
\\
The telecommand contains the following services:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Changing instrument modes
    \item Manually control valves, pump, and heaters
    \DIFaddbegin \item \DIFadd{Change sampling schedule
}\DIFaddend \end{itemize}

Furthermore, telemetry contains the services below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data from temperature, pressure and airflow sensor
    \item Current instrument modes
    \item Instrument housekeeping data (valve, pump, and heater states)
\end{itemize}
\item{Data Acquisition and Storage}\\
Data will be stored on the SD memory card on the Arduino Ethernet Shield using the FAT16 and FAT32 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{filesystems}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{file systems}\DIFaddend . To minimize data loss in the event of an reset we will only write to the same file in a set amount of time before closing it and open a new file. It is estimated that for the entire flight, all the sensors will produce less than $5$ MB of data. The sampling rate will be fixed at 1 sampling per second.\\
\\
The data will be collected and presented as a matrix, where the first column is the time frame, the following columns are the sensors data. After the sensors data, there will also be housekeeping data, that keeps track of the valves, and heaters states. However, the size of the housekeeping data is not expected to surpass 20 bits per sampling.\\
\\
Data will be continuously down-linked two times per second and the total telemetry size is less than $4$ MB for 10 hours of flight. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{On the other hand, the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend telecommand size will \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on the other hand }\DIFaddend vary based on how many subcommand is sent each time. If all of the subcommand are enabled, the total size is 128 bytes. Considering the telecommand will not be sent more than once per second, the telecommand data rate is 126 bytes/sec.
\item{Process Flow}\\
The process flow can be explained with the mode diagram in Figure \ref{fig:modediag}. The software will start with Standby Mode, in which the software will get samples from all sensors. The on-board memory card contains the default sampling schedule parameters (when the sampling will start and stop), which will be read by the software \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in Standby Mode}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{during initialization of the OBS}\DIFaddend . This will allow users to change the sampling schedule without changing the internal code. When the software receives negative increment of pressure changes, it will change to Normal - Ascent mode, where the software will trigger emptying of the CAC's coiled tube by opening the valves. Then, at certain altitudes, air sampling will be conducted during Ascent Phase. During Float Phase, no sampling will be conducted. The software will go to Normal - Descent mode when it detects the increment of pressure is considerably big at which point the software will sample the air by opening the valves for each bag in their designated altitude. Considering that the gondola might not have smooth \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ascending}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ascent}\DIFaddend /\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{descending}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{descent}\DIFaddend , the mode changes will only happen if the changes exceed \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend certain threshold. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Currently, \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$\SI{-20}{\pascal}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
and \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$\SI{20}{\pascal}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{After analysis and testing, \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$\SI{-20}{h\pascal}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
and \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$\SI{20}{h\pascal}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend are considered as the threshold\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and might be changed depending on further analysis and testing}\DIFdelend . The experiment goes to SAFE mode approximately \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{500 m }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\SI{1200}{\meter} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend before the landing, and triggers all the valves to be closed. The manual mode is entered with a telecommand and left with another one. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{When entering the manual mode the groundstation automatically retransmits the signal for manual mode at a set interval. If the signal is not }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{If no telecommand is }\DIFaddend received by the OBC within a certain amount of time it leaves manual mode and enters into standby mode.

In the sampling algorithm, it is necessary to keep track of the time because the bag cannot be filled fully (it might burst). A simple library is used to keep track of the time from the start of the experiment.\par

    \caption{Onboard Software Design Tree.}\label{fig:obtree}
\end{figure}

The software design is produced by using object oriented approach. The functionality of the experiment has been divided into several objects and their children. The design tree is shown in Figure \ref{fig:obtree}.\\
\\
The Telemetry object is responsible to format the sensor/housekeeping data, and to transmit it. MODE is responsible for controlling the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{four }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{five }\DIFaddend modes of software. INIT will initialize the necessary software\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{programs}\DIFdelend . COMMANDS reads the telecommands and execute their commands. The AIR SAMPLING CONTROL object \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{have }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{has }\DIFaddend the four children objects. The first child is responsible for controlling the pump. The second child contains the parameters for the valves and pump. The third child reads the data from the sensors, a fourth child is responsible for manipulating the valves.\\
\\
The SENSOR object \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{have }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{has }\DIFaddend two children objects. One for sampling the sensors and another for recording and storing the housekeeping data. The HEATER object \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{have }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{has }\DIFaddend three children objects. One for reading the temperature sensor data, another for deciding if the heaters should be turn on/off. And the third child for turning it on/off.\\ 
\\
The MONITOR object utilizes a watchdog timer that causes an interrupt when it reaches \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0, underflow. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0. }\DIFaddend The watchdog does not get fed directly from by the end of the different tasks. Instead the tasks sets a flag, if all the flags are set the watchdog gets reset and the countdown starts from the beginning. If the watchdog times out before all the flags are set the monitor object resets the board.\\
\\
Each of the objects interacts with each others fulfilling mutually exclusive interaction. It means that any shared variables can only be accessed by one object at time. This is important considering the program is be fully automatic and to prevent unnecessary data lost. The objects interface diagrams and their sequence diagrams can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:appB} and \ref{sec:appC}.

These tasks are \begin{itemize}
    \item The Sampler task (periodic)
    \item The Reading task (periodic)
    \item heaterTask task (periodic)
    \item telecommand task (sporadic)
\end{itemize} 
Several libraries that are used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item FreeRTOS\_ARM.h (FreeRTOS specially port for ARM microprocessor like Due)
    \item ArduinoSTL.h (allows standard C++ functionality)
    \item RTCDue.h (keeps track of the time from the software start)
    \item Necessary Arduino libraries.
    \item \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{DS1631.h (self made library)

\subsection{Ground Support Equipment}\label{sec:4.9}
The purpose of the ground station is to monitor in real-time the experiment and provide manual override capability in case the experiment failed functioning autonomously. The manual override is able to control all the valves, pump, and heaters. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{It also provide a service to change the sampling schedule while in flight. }\DIFaddend \par
One personal computer will be used to connect to the E-Link through the Ethernet port. A GUI is created to display the sensors data and valves, pump states during the experiment. MATLAB GUIDE is used for the development. \par
The design of the ground station is responsible for receiving and transmitting data over the provided Ethernet connection. Using GUIDE to create a GUI and respective functions as a skeleton, the necessary  functionality to receive, transmit and display are built accordingly. The functions are defined for each GUI element.

    \item If a re-test is required the wait time could be \DIFdelbeginFL \DIFdelFL{in }\DIFdelendFL \DIFaddbeginFL \DIFaddFL{on }\DIFaddendFL the order of weeks or months.
    \item Testing could potentially break a non-spare component with a long re-order time.
\end{itemize}\\ \hline
Medium & 2, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 27, 29, 30 & \begin{itemize}
    \item Requires internal cooperation or multiple parts of the experiment completed to a minimum standard.
    \item If a re-test is required the wait time could be \DIFdelbeginFL \DIFdelFL{in }\DIFdelendFL \DIFaddbeginFL \DIFaddFL{on }\DIFaddendFL the order of days.
    \item Testing could potentially break a critical component that would require re-ordering or replacing.
\end{itemize} \\ \hline
Low & 3, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 25, 28, 31, 32 & \begin{itemize}
    \item Can be performed by a single department.
    \item If a re-test is required the wait time could be \DIFdelbeginFL \DIFdelFL{in }\DIFdelendFL \DIFaddbeginFL \DIFaddFL{on }\DIFaddendFL the order of hours.

\subsubsection{Test Descriptions}

If a non-destructive test is not proceeding as expected \textit{and} it is thought there is a risk to components it will be aborted. If a test is aborted for this reason an investigation must be completed to discover why it did not proceed as expected and the issue resolved before a re-test can occur.

Tests will take place on the flight model due to budget and time restrictions which prevent a test model from being created. However, if a component is broken during testing spares are available. Tests 4 and 5 will not use the entire model due to size restrictions in the chambers. Instead only critical components will be tested.

All test \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{procedure and duration's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{procedures and durations }\DIFaddend are subject to change.

\subsection{Test Results} \DIFaddbegin \label{sec:5.3}
\DIFaddend The results shown here provide the key information obtained from testing. A full report for each test can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:apptestres}.

\subsubsection{Test 28: Pump Operations}
\label{sec:test28result}

It was found that when the power supply was switched on the current went up to 600 mA for less than one second. It then settled to 250 mA. By covering the air intake, simulating air intake from a lower pressure, the current drops to 200 mA. By covering the air output, simulating pushing air into a higher pressure, the current rises to 400 mA.

Therefore the power for each of these conditions is 14.4 W at turn on, 6 W in normal use, 4.8 W when sucking from low pressure, 9.6 W when pushing to high pressure.

\subsubsection{Test 18: Pump Low Pressure}\label{subsection:pumplowpressuretest}

The pump was tested at low pressure using a small vacuum chamber down to \SI{10}{\hecto\pascal}. Flow rates were recorded from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\SI{30}{\hecto\pascal}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\SI{75}{\hecto\pascal}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , the expected highest sampling altitude.

 The results can also be seen in Table \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{tab:pump-low-pressure-result} and Figure \ref{fig:pump-performance}.
Note that the results should be considered an approximation due to the lack of equipment such as flow-meters that would have made this test more precise.

\subsubsection{Test 30: Sampling Bag Bursting}
\label{sec:test30result}

A sampling bag was placed in a small vacuum chamber connected to the pump and the pump was run for 3 minutes with a full bag to see how the bag reacted. 

It was found that there are two potential failure modes. The first is a slow leakage caused by damage to the bag seal and the second is  a rapid failure of the bag seal leading to total loss of the sample.

It can be concluded that, as long as the bags are well secured to the valves at the bottom and through the metal ring at the top, bag bursting during flight would not cause damage to any other components on board. Even during the more energetic burst that occurs from continuous pumping the bag remained fixed to the valve connection and experienced no fragmentation. The consequences of a single bag burst would be limited to loss of data and a disturbance to audio frequencies. 

\subsubsection{Test 29: Pump Current under Low Pressure}
\label{sec:test29result}

In general it was found that decreasing the pressure, or increasing the altitude, lead to a decrease in pump current draw. The full results can be seen in Table \ref{tab:pumpcurrentpressure}. 

\begin{table}[H]
\centering

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Altitude (km)} & \textbf{Pressure (hPa)} & \textbf{Into Bag Current (mA)} & \textbf{Into Seal Current (mA)} \\ \hline
20 & 57 & 140 & 138 \\ \hline
18 & 68 & 150 & 141 \\ \hline
16 & 100 & 161 & 146 \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{Table Showing How the Current Draw of the Pump Changed With Outside Air Pressure for Two Different Conditions. The First Pumping Into a Sampling Bag and the Second Pumping Into a Sealed Tube.}
\label{tab:pumpcurrentpressure}
\end{table}

From the table it can be seen that the current draw is higher during the bag filling than during the sealed case. As the experiment will sample between 11 km and 24 km it can be concluded that the highest current draw will occur during the 11 km altitude sample and can be expected to be around 200 mA. 

\subsubsection{Test 17: Sampling bags' holding times and samples'\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{condensation verification}\DIFdelend }
\label{sec:test17result}

The main objective of this test was to flush eight 1 L sampling bags with nitrogen, the same way it will be done for the flight.

}

\DIFadd{This test had to and was repeated, using the set-up described in Section 4, with some differences. This time 3L bags were flushed with dry gas and left outside for 15, 24, 48 hours. After the flushing was done, two bags for each time were filled with 0.5 L and 1L of dry gas and left outside. Then they were analyzed and checked if the sample concentrations were the same or close enough with the reference values of the filled dry gas.

A sampling bag was flushed the way it will be flushed before flight, and then analyzed immediately.

\DIFaddbegin \textbf{\DIFadd{Styrofoam}}

\DIFaddend The same vacuum chamber was used as in Tests 18 and 29. The Styrofoam was measured on each side before it was placed in the chamber.

\DIFadd{After the first airflow in vacuum test failed due to datalogging errors the airflow test was repeated. In this repeated test all of the Brain was placed into the vacuum chamber and one bag attached. It was not possible to attach more than one bag due to space restrictions. 
}

\DIFadd{The flow rate seemed to be too low for the rate the bag was inflating in the chamber. It was concluded that the airflow rate displayed is }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{measuring technique and not due to changes in the Styrofoam.

\subsubsection{Test 32: Software Failure}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{So far testing has revealed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{it was found }\DIFaddend that losing the SD card does not interrupt ground station data, it just means no data will be written to the SD card. However, if you reconnect the SD after removing it \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{currently it }\DIFdelend will not connect back to the SD card and it as if the SD card has been permanently lost.\DIFaddbegin \par

\DIFadd{The second failure test is how the software handles unexpected reset. The most concerning problem is which bag that will be sampled after the reset. It has been tested that the software could read the current sampling status from SD card and continue where it left off. 
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Test 31: Unit Test}}
\DIFadd{Unit test was used to test several software non-hardware dependent functionality e.g. translating telecommand, storing measurements data to buffer. The functions were tested for several expected cases and a few bugs were discovered and fixed.

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Test 33: Electrical Component Testing}}
\label{sec:Test33Test-Electronical-Component-Testing}
\DIFadd{The components were tested separately, one by one to double check and determine their power consumption and their functionality. Some tests were also run to determine specific resistances on voltage bridges and pull down resistors for LEDs running at different voltages. These tests gave further insight to the PCB design and the power design. The test results were according to expectations and the design and assembly could continue as planned. There were also some test run for the PCB, which showed that some connections were not done in the way that was planned due to design issues. Theses were solved by adding wires to the PCB instead of redesigning the PCB and order a new one due to time and budget limitations. For further details on these tests see Section \ref{sec:test33result}.

\DIFadd{For a non team member to perform the removal of the CAC box based on the given instructions, it took that person 6 min and 25 sec. This time is expected to be lower for the recovery team as the items to be unscrewed were not yet clearly marked. One problem that occurred during this test was that the person had problems to distinguishing the CAC from the AAC box. To resolve this the boxes now have clear labels on them.

\DIFadd{The full software was run in auto mode to check everything operated as expected over a full test flight. At the end of the simulated flight the experiment was to shutdown automatically. This was tested both on the bench and in the vacuum chamber. In the vacuum chamber tests, see Section \ref{lowpressure}, the bench test, see Appendix \ref{benchtest} and the thermal test, see Appendix \ref{thermaltestresults} data collection was also monitored. It was found that the physical samples were being collected properly and all the sensors were returning expected data.

\subsubsection{Launch Site Requirements}
The experiment needs some preparations before the flight. For that reason, the team will need a room with a big table to place the Picarro analyzer, with some extra space for all the interfaces between the analyzer and the CAC system, as well as the AAC system.
A laptop PC will be used to monitor the experiment. Therefore, a desk and a chair are needed for this station. A total of 16 chairs need to be rented: 13 chairs for all members of the TUBULAR Team and an additional three for visiting collaborators from FMI. One power outlet and one Ethernet cable for E-link connection are also essential for the laptop PC.

\subsubsection{Flight Requirements}

Floating altitude is desired to be as high as possible in order to sample air from the stratosphere both in ascent and Decent Phase. The duration of the Float Phase is not relevant for the experiment performance. 

\smallskip
No conditions for visibility are required for this experiment.

\smallskip
With respect to a swift recovery and transport for fast data analysis, a launch time in the early morning hours would be favorable.

\pagebreak
\subsubsection{Accommodation Requirements}

The experiment involves two rectangular boxes inside the gondola environment. The only requirement is to allocate the box with at least one face exposed to the outside. The latter will also facilitate the fast experiment recovery for the later analysis of the collected samples. The design allows full adaptability regarding the interface with the gondola's rails, for more details see Section \ref{Mechanical_Design}. The current location of the experiment in Figure \ref{goldola_accommodation} is the one arranged with REXUS/BEXUS Coordinators during the Training Week in Esrange.

\subsection{Preparation and Test Activities at Esrange}\label{prep_for_Esrange}
The ground station laptop PC will need to be put in place and set up so it is operational. The communication through E-link with the experiment shall be tested. The air sampling schedule on the SD card has to be checked before flight.

In the preparation phase magnesium filters will be prepared. These are short (7 cm) lengths of stainless steel tubing that will be filled with \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 mg of }\DIFaddend fresh magnesium perchlorate powder \cite{Karion}. One will be attached to the inlet of the CAC tubing, to ensure that no moisture enters the tubing during testing or sampling. The magnesium perchlorate powder will be loosely packed to make sure that the air flow is not blocked. Stone wool will be placed at both ends of the tube to prevent the powder escaping from the filter.

The same set-up will be used for the AAC. As stratospheric air is dry the risk of moisture entering the system during sampling is very low\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend however, the team decided to use one to reduce the risk of condensation in the samples after landing. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The day }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{One or two days }\DIFaddend before the flight \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, both CAC and AAC have to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the CAC will }\DIFaddend go through some preparations. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For the CAC, the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend coiled tube will be flushed and filled with a fill gas. A fill gas is air with a spike of a known gas, for example CO. During the flushing process the coiled tube\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and solenoid valveand }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, solenoid valve, }\DIFaddend the exit tube \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be flushed separately. The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as well as the }\DIFaddend magnesium perchlorate filter will \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{not be flushed because it is not necessary}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{be flushed separately}\DIFaddend . In the flushing process the quick connectors at outlet and inlet will be connected to the fill gas bottle and Picarro analyzer respectively. A fill gas will then flow through the coiled tube all the way to the Picarro. It will be flushed over night at a flow rate of 40 ml/min to ensure unknown gases inside the tube will be removed. Meanwhile on other hand the solenoid valve and the exit tube will be flushed manually. The outlet and inlet will be sealed while the gas is still running through the CAC and therefore the CAC will be filled. Thereafter it will be attached to \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend remaining components such as the magnesium perchlorate filter, solenoid valve and exit tube. At this stage the CAC is ready for the flight. 

A pre-launch checklist in Appendix \ref{sec:appL}, was made to assure that the flight preparations will be done thoroughly. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This includes a step by step flushing procedure.
}\DIFaddend 

For the AAC \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{all the bags }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{system, the tubing, and the manifold }\DIFaddend will be cleaned by flushing them with a dry gas \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the night before the flight}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as soon as all the pre-flight testing is done}\DIFaddend . The dry gas is extracted from the fill gas and has slightly different concentrations from the fill gas. The dry gas bottle, the vacuum pump and the AAC system, will all be connected as a system to the central valve. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Using the AAC valves and the bags manual valve to control which bags are sealed and which are opened the process will go through each bag individually. The central valve 's position will determine whether the dry gas or the vacuum is open . When the valve is open }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{When the central valve is open }\DIFaddend to dry gas\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the sampling bags are being filled and when it is open to vacuum they are being emptied. The flushing has to be done three times for each bag to ensure the bags are properly cleaned. A flow sensor will be placed close to the central valve, making sure that all bags will be filled with 3 L of dry gas . After the end of this procedure, when the bags are empty again, each bag will be sealed, by closing its valve, while the vacuum pump is open }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, dry gas will start flowing into the AAC manifold while the flushing valve is open with the rest of the valves closed}\DIFaddend . The pump and the valves of the AAC system will \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{also }\DIFdelend be cleaned by this procedure.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{It is anticipated this process will take around 4 hours to complete.
}\DIFdelend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Once the sampling bags have been cleaned and sealed, the system of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In a second phase, using the AAC valves this time, the }\DIFaddend tubes between the bags and the manifold \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{have to be flushedwith the dry gas as well. Again, only }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{will be flushed, again after the pre-flight testing is done. Only }\DIFaddend one tube will be flushed at a time, using the central valve, the T-union\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend and the solenoid valve that matches the tube to control which tube is being flushed. The tubes have to be flushed until ten times their volume has passed through, this will be monitored with the air flow sensor. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A quick connector with stem will be connected at the T-Union, so that air can exit the system. }\DIFaddend When flushing is complete the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{dry gas connection }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{quick connector with stem }\DIFaddend will be removed from the T-union and the T-union will be automatically closed (quick connector interface). The corresponding solenoid valve shall be closed at the same time the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{fill gas }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{quick connector with stem }\DIFaddend is disconnected. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{dry gas }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{stem quick connector }\DIFaddend is then connected to the next tube\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'s T-union }\DIFaddend and the same procedure follows. 
    \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{After the flushing of all the tubes is complete, and the system is sealed, the pump will be started with the flushing valve open, to flush the AAC system. At the end, the pump will be shut off, the flushing valvewill be closed, and the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{Finally, once the AAC manifold and the tubes have been cleaned, the bags have to be flushed with the dry gas as well. This will happen the night before the flight. One bag will be flushed at a time by connecting the dry gas bottle, and the vacuum pump system with the T-union of the corresponding bag. It is important to make sure that the bags manual valve is open. The central valve's position will determine whether the dry gas or the vacuum is open. When the valve is open to dry gas the sampling bags are being filled and when it is open to vacuum they are being emptied. The flushing has to be done three times for each bag to ensure the bags are properly cleaned. A flow sensor will be placed close to the central valve, making sure that all bags will be filled with 3 L of dry gas. After the end of this procedure, when the bags are empty again, the dry gas bottle and the vacuum pump will be disconnected from the corresponding bag's T-union while the vacuum pump is open. At this point, the }\DIFaddend AAC will be ready for flight. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Note that the manual valves of the sampling bags have to be opened before flight}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{It is anticipated this process will take around 3 hours to complete}\DIFaddend .

%DIF > Once the sampling bags have been cleaned and sealed, the system of tubes between the bags and the manifold have to be flushed with the dry gas as well. Again, only one tube will be flushed at a time, using the central valve, the T-union and the solenoid valve that matches the tube to control which tube is being flushed. The tubes have to be flushed until ten times their volume has passed through, this will be monitored with the air flow sensor. When flushing is complete the dry gas connection will be removed from the T-union and the T-union will be automatically closed (quick connector interface). The corresponding solenoid valve shall be closed at the same time the fill gas is disconnected. The dry gas is then connected to the next tube and the same procedure follows. After the flushing of all the tubes is complete, and the system is sealed, the pump will be started with the flushing valve open, to flush the AAC system. At the end, the pump will be shut off, the flushing valve will be closed, and the AAC will be ready for flight. Note that the manual valves of the sampling bags have to be opened before flight.    
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend The pre-launch checklist in Appendix \ref{sec:appL} will again make sure that all the steps will be done correctly and in the right order. 

In a laboratory phase, tests under monitored conditions will be done to evaluate the overall consistency of the CAC and the AAC. In particular, the CAC and the AAC shall be tested for leaks at the junctions and at the valves. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{What is more}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Furthermore}\DIFaddend , the team has decided to clean the rest of the experiment's components, such as the Brain, as well as the structure. Doing so, any unwanted particles released during the experiment's construction, will be removed avoiding these particles to enter the pneumatic system and thus contaminating the collected samples. 
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend For that reason, an appropriate device for small and sensitive components, such as a vacuum cleaner or a machine that blows air, will be used. If this is not possible, then the experiment will be cleaned manually with a dust cloth \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, considering }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{given }\DIFaddend that this cleaning procedure is not of high need as the cleaning of the coil or the bags. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{What is more, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Considering that }\DIFaddend the building of the experiment will take place in a lab, which is a clean environment\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. Therefore }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend this action will be done once before the flight, and the procedure may change if another, more effective way of cleaning is found. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{It is yet to be decided whether this }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This }\DIFaddend procedure will be done \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the day before the flight or some day earlier}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{just after EAR}\DIFaddend .

\subsection{Timeline for Countdown and Flight}
Table \ref{tab:countflight} is the estimated timeline during countdown and flight. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{It may undergo updates in future versions of the SED.
}\DIFdelend 

The desired altitudes in which air samples are to be collected with the sampling bags are associated with specific air pressure values. Thus, the valve operations to sample air during the balloon \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ascent }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Ascent }\DIFaddend and Descent Phases are to be triggered by readings from the ambient pressure sensor. The time values presented in Table \ref{tab:countflight} merely serve as an indicative estimate of when the sampling will take place as sampling will not be programmed based on flight time.

\subsection{Post Flight Activities}

\subsubsection{CAC Recovery}
It is important that the CAC is recovered as quickly as possible. The experiment has been designed so that the recovery team can easily remove the AirCore in the CAC box from the gondola without having to remove the entire experiment. This is to facilitate possible transportation back to Esrange via helicopter.

This quick recovery is important to minimize the length of time in which mixing of the gas occurs in the collected CAC sample. The sample should be analyzed within five to six hours after the experiment lands. At PDR it was discussed that the CAC box could be brought back to Esrange on the helicopter instead of the truck. This situation would be preferable for TUBULAR Team. 
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend The FMI team will arrive at Esrange \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{one or two days before the launch }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on the 12th of October }\DIFaddend with all the necessary equipment for pre-flight flushing and post-flight analysis. Having the FMI team at Esrange will give additional time for them to install and calibrate their lab equipment and also allow them to proceed faster with the analysis process as soon as the CAC is returned to Esrange. 

Detailed instructions are provided on how to remove the CAC box. In addition, instructions are provided to ensure that the system is completely shut down and the valves secured. Shutdown will be automated\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend however, a manual shutdown mechanism will be included should the automation fail.

\section{Data Analysis and Results}

\subsection{Data Analysis Plan}

\subsubsection{Picarro G2401}

The analyzer that will be used is the model Picarro G2401. It uses near-infrared Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) technology and is capable of measuring four atmospheric trace gases simultaneously and continuously ($CO, CO_2, CH_4, H_2O$).

The CRDS technique's basic principle is shown in Figure \ref{fig:CRDS}. Light from a semiconductor diode laser is used. There is an optical cavity filled with the gas that has to be analyzed and the aim is to determine the decay time of the diode laser light. As it can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:CRDS}, the sample gas is introduced in a cavity with three high-reflectivity mirrors. When the laser is shut off, the light that was circulating in the cavity decays with a characteristic time which is measured. If the wavelength of the injected light does not match any absorption feature of any gas in the cavity, the decay time is dominated by mirror loss and it is very long. On the other side, when the wavelength of the injected light is resonant with an absorption feature of a species in the cavity, the decay time is short and decreases as the reciprocal of the species concentration.

    \caption{Schematics of CRDS Analyzer Showing Optical Cavity and Sample Gas Flow \cite{Picarro}.\label{fig:CRDS}}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:Picarro-interfaces} shows the back of the analyzer with gas supply, electrical and computer connections. The analyzer can be configured to deliver data in different formats: digital or analogue. When the main power is turned on the analyzer will automatically start, including the Graphical User Interface (GUI).

    \caption{Back of Picarro G2401 Analyzer Showing Gas Supply, Electrical and Computer Connections \cite{Picarrouserguide}.\label{fig:Picarro-interfaces}}
\end{figure}


Before the Picarro analyzer is ready for analysis, it is necessary to run a calibrating gas through it in order to remove moisture inside and to have stable measurements to compare with. Figure \ref{fig:picarro-connections} shows the Picarro set up at FMI in Sodankyl\"{a}. A three way valve controls which is the gas flowing into the analyzer. The tube labelled as "AIRCORE" is the one to be connected to the sample, either sampling bags or CAC. The tube labelled as "PICARRO" is the one that goes to the Picarro's inlet and the third tube, without a label, is connected to the calibrating gas bottle.This set up allows easy changing between the samples, dry gas and fill gas with the calibrating gas without getting moisture inside.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{align*}
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{7-data-analysis-and-results/img/picarro-connections.jpeg}
    \end{align*}
    \caption{Picarro Set-up Connections at FMI in Sodankyl\"{a}. \label{fig:picarro-connections}}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:picarro-GUI} shows the Picarro GUI during analysis. From top to bottom: $CO_2$ ppm, $CO$ ppm, $CH_4$ ppm and cavity pressure. These options can be changed during analysis as it only means that those are the ones being displayed. Figure \ref{fig:picarro-GUI} was taken minutes after a change between dry gas-sample had been done so a change in the concentrations of $CO_2$ and $CH_4$ can be easily appreciated. 
The Picarro analyzer does not only give information about the displayed parameters, all the data is saved in a .dat file to be analyzed afterwards. The most relevant logged parameters are time, date, ambient pressure, cavity pressure, cavity temperature, $CO$ concentration, $CO_2$, $CH_4$ and $H_2O$ normal and dry concentration. The dry concentration is a correction done automatically by the Picarro analyzer taking into account the moisture inside the analyzer.

    \caption{Picarro Graphical User Interface. From Top to Bottom: $CO_2$ ppm, $CO$ ppm, $CH_4$ ppm and Cavity Pressure. \label{fig:picarro-GUI}}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Analysis Strategy}

As it has been mentioned in the previous section, during the flight, calibrating gas will be flowing through the Picarro G2401. After the flight, the collected samples from the CAC and the AAC will be analyzed. As it is shown in Figure \ref{fig:aircore-analysis}, the end of the CAC tube that remains closed during sampling will be connected to the Picarro inlet. The other end of the CAC will be connected to the fill gas that will act as a push gas. As soon as this connection is done, the valve shown in Figure \ref{fig:picarro-connections} will be switched from calibrating gas to "AIRCORE" position. Then the Picarro GUI will show a sudden drop/increase in concentrations similar to the one shown in Figure \ref{fig:picarro-GUI} due to the difference between the calibrating gas and the sample concentrations. Note that the magnesium perchlorate dryer shown in Figure \ref{fig:aircore-analysis} is removed during analysis.  

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{align*}
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{7-data-analysis-and-results/img/aircore-analysis.png}
    \end{align*}
    \caption{Schematics of CAC Analysis System \cite{AircoreFlights}. \label{fig:aircore-analysis}}
\end{figure}

The analyzer pump and the push gas help the sample to go through the analyzer. The analysis will be started from the side which contains the samples taken at higher altitudes to avoid losing resolution. The beginning and end of the sample analysis is detected due to changes in concentrations, at the beginning between calibrating gas/sample, and at the end, between sample/fill gas. Once the analysis is done, the sample taken with the CAC is stored in a sampler as seen in Figure \ref{fig:aircore-sampler}. This CAC sampler is at FMI and contains fifteen separate sections. All the valves are open when the sample is introduced. Once the analysis is finished and the whole sample is in the sampler, all the valves are closed at the same time, separating the samples for different altitudes and preventing further molecular diffusion.  


\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{align*}
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{7-data-analysis-and-results/img/aircore-sampler.jpeg}
    \end{align*}
    \caption{CAC Sampler with 15 Different Stages. \label{fig:aircore-sampler}}
\end{figure}


After the sample has been analyzed, the time trace of analysis will be converted into a mole fraction profile as a function of atmospheric pressure, using the ideal gas law,
\begin{equation}
    PV = nRT <=> n = \frac{PV}{RT}
    \label{eq:idealgaslaw}
\end{equation}
where P is the ambient pressure, V is the inner volume of the CAC/AAC, n the fraction of moles, R is the universal gas constant in $J K^{-1} mol^{-1}$ and T the ambient temperature in Kelvin, \cite{Membrive}. 
A constant unit of pressure in the atmosphere is represented by a unit of length in the CAC tube, due to the method that the CAC will sample the ambient air.

During the analysis the number of moles that will go through the analyzer will increase linearly with time. So, the number of moles at any time during the analysis will be
\begin{equation}
    n_i = n^{max}\frac{t_i}{\Delta t}
    \label{eq:ni}
\end{equation}
where $n^{max}$ is the maximum number of moles i.e when the CAC reaches the Earth's surface, and $\Delta t$ is the total time duration of the analysis between the top and bottom of the CAC sample.   

Finally, the vertical profiles will be obtained by using equations \ref{eq:idealgaslaw} and \ref{eq:ni}, and relate a specific pressure point with every Picarro measurement of the sample.   

The AAC sampling system will be analyzed, in the same manner as the CAC, using the same Picarro gas analyzer. In the same way as for the CAC, the calibrating gas needs to be flowing through the analyzer until the moisture is minimum and the readings in concentrations are stable. Then a sampling bags system will be connected to the analyzer and a dry gas bottle, in a similar way as it was done in Test 17. The tubes connecting the sampling bags will be flushed with dry gas and when the concentrations given by the Picarro analyzer are stable, the air inside the sampling bags will go through the analyzer followed again by dry gas.  

Watching at the Picarro GUI, it is easily recognizable when a sampling bag is being analyzed due to the difference in concentrations between its air and the dry gas. 

Again, as for the CAC, equations \ref{eq:idealgaslaw} and \ref{eq:ni} are going to be used to relate a specific pressure point with every Picarro measurement of the sample. 


The basic working principle used by the chromatographer to obtain the concentrations is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Have calibrating gas - sample - calibrating gas flowing through the analyzer. (It could also be the case: calibrating gas - dry gas - sample - dry gas - calibrating gas but the principle is the same). 
    \item Identify in the GUI readings the different gases easily seen by sudden variations in the concentrations. 
    \item Compare the calibrating gas reading with the known real value. Do this before and after the sample. This difference corresponds to the drift given by the Picarro. 
    \item Interpolate the values of drift from before and after the sample to obtain the drift during the sample. 
    \item Correct the readings given by the Picarro analyzer due to drift and that is the real concentration value. 
\end{itemize}

NOTE: A calibrating gas is a gas that has been flowing through the Picarro analyzer multiple times and its concentration is known with accuracy. A calibrating gas has to flow before and after the samples in order to compare the readings given by the analyzer with the real value and obtain a corrected value for the samples.

\subsection{Launch Campaign}
\subsubsection{Flight preparation activities during launch campaign} %.... maybe some of this is currently in chapter 6
The flight preparations can be found in Section \ref{prep_for_Esrange}.

\subsubsection{Flight performance}
It is expected to receive a downlink from the gondola. All data received will be stored in the ground station computer. The estimated data across the E-link will be $7.128$ MB, while the stored data onboard SD card is estimated to be $6.552$ MB.

\subsubsection{Recovery}
If our request for quick helicopter recovery of the CAC is granted, the retrieval team will be provided a checklist, in Section \ref{sec:recovery-checklist}, so they can pull out the CAC from the gondola while the AAC will be brought back with the rest of the gondola.

\subsubsection{Post flight activities}
Once the gondola has been brought back, the samples collected by the CAC and AAC will be analyzed.

\subsection{Results}

No results for now. More will come after the launch campaign in an updated version of the SED. 

\subsubsection{Expected Results}

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \label{sec:ExpecterResults}
\DIFaddend After the analysis of the samples, the expected results are the vertical profiles of CO, CO$_2$, and CH$_4$. The profiles will present a similar pattern to that of Figure \ref{fig:vertical-profile-karion}. The continuous profile (dashed line) belongs to the CAC while the discrete values (black dots) belongs to the AAC (\cite{Karion}). Both profiles are showing a decrease in concentration of CH$_2$ and CH$_4$ with increasing altitude.

    \caption{Pressure Profiles for (Left) CO$_2$ and (Right) CH$_4$ by Three Different Methods \cite{Karion}.\label{fig:vertical-profile-karion}}
\end{figure}

The experiment's goal is to achieve the highest vertical resolution possible. Since the vertical resolution is determined by the length and the diameter of the tube \cite{Membrive}, a 300 m long tube will be used, consisting of 2 smaller tubes. One of 200 m length with \num{3e-3} m outside diameter and \num{1.3e-4} m wall thickness, and another one of 100 m length with \num{6e-3} m outside diameter and \num{1.3e-4} m wall thickness. For achieving higher stratospheric resolution, the tube with the smaller diameter will be used to sample the higher altitudes and the one with the bigger diameter for the lower ones.
Figure \ref{fig:resolution-lenght} by Olivier Membrive \cite{Membrive} compares the vertical resolution that can be expected with three different AirCores.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{align*}
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{7-data-analysis-and-results/img/ResolutionVslength.png}
    \end{align*}
    \caption{Comparison of the Vertical Resolutions That can be Expected with Different AirCores, After 3h Storage Time Before Analysis \cite{Membrive}.\label{fig:resolution-lenght}}
\end{figure}

The High-Resolution AirCore-HR (red line),\cite{Membrive}, is a combination of two tubes. One of 200 m and one of 100 m.

The NOAA 'original' CAC, \cite{Karion}, (black line) is a 152 m long tube and the AirCore-GUF (designed and developed at Goethe University Frankfurt), (blue line) is a combination of three tubes, 100 m long in total.

The longer AirCore, AirCore-HR, achieved a higher resolution throughout the whole sampled air. 

In addition, the vertical resolution depends on the the mixing inside the tube. 

The experiment takes into account two types of mixing. Molecular diffusion and the shear flow diffusion, known as Taylor dispersion. The effect of molecular diffusion is described by the root-mean-square of the distance of molecular travel, 
\begin{equation}
    X_{rms} = \sqrt{2Dt}
\end{equation}
where, D is the molecular diffusivity of the molecule in the surrounding gas, and t is the time over which travel occurs, \cite{Karion}.
For the tubing dimension that will be used in this experiment, the flow of air through the CAC, will be laminar. In such a flow, a parabolic velocity profile exists inside the tube, causing longitudinal mixing (Taylor dispersion). 

Before the experiment is recovered, only molecular diffusion will affect the sample, but during analysis both molecular diffusion and Taylor dispersion will affect the sample. Combining both of them, an effective diffusion coefficient can be calculated as,
 \begin{equation}
     D{eff} = D + \frac{a^2\overline{V^2}}{48D}
 \end{equation}
where D is the molecular diffusivity, a is the tube's inner radius, and $\overline{V}$ is the average velocity \cite{Membrive}. The first term translates into the longitudinal direction, while the second one is the Taylor dispersion. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The exact flow rates are to be decided at a later stage of the experiment}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{After completing Test 4 and Test 18 as seen in Tables \ref{tab:vacuum-test}, and \ref{tab:pump-low-pressure-test} respectively, the team managed to get the standard flow rate readings for the different altitudes.

\DIFaddend Finally, storage time, that is the time from the moment the tube is sealed until the end of the analysis, is a key factor that affects the experiment's results in terms of resolution.

Figure \ref{fig:resolution-time} shows the effect of time delay between landing and analysis, on the expected vertical resolution. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{align*}
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{7-data-analysis-and-results/img/ResolutionVsTime.png}
    \end{align*}
    \caption{Expected Vertical Resolution of AirCore-HR, for a Storage Time of 3h (Black), 6h (Blue), 12h (Green), 24h (Orange) and 1 Week (Red) \cite{Membrive}.\label{fig:resolution-time}}
\end{figure}

It is clear that the sooner the samples are going to be analyzed, the better the results for the vertical resolution of the CAC sample. At an altitude of 20 km the resolution decreases significantly from 300 m to 500 m for 6h and 12h of delay, respectively, \cite{Membrive}. But even after a week of storage, a vertical profile can still be achieved with lower resolution.

Based on past BEXUS projects, the time to experiment recovery is estimated at 12 to 24 hours, if not multiple days. As such, it is expected that the desired vertical resolution of gas analysis will favour AAC configuration over that of CAC due to mixing of gases in the latter configuration, resulting in poorer vertical resolution.

The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{maximum }\DIFdelend vertical resolution for the AAC is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{capped at }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{approximately }\DIFaddend 500 m. This will be achieved assuring the airflow intake rate. For Ascent Phase, a nominal speed of 5 m/s is considered, which means that it will take \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{100 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{28.57 }\DIFaddend seconds to fill \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{up a 3 L sampling bag while ascending 500 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a sampling bag with 1.8L of air while ascending 142.85 }\DIFaddend m, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{therefore the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an  actual }\DIFaddend airflow intake rate \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{should be of approximately 1.8 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of approximately 3.78 }\DIFaddend L/min \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{at 18 km of altitude}\DIFaddend . For Descent Phase, the nominal speed is assumed to be 8 m/s. While descending \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{500 m a 3 L }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{156.4 m a }\DIFaddend sampling bag will be filled in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{62 seconds}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{19.55 seconds, with 1.3 L of air and an actual airflow intake rate of 3.99 L/min at 16 km of altitude}\DIFaddend . However, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{considering the fact that the pump will not have the same efficiency at higher altitudes, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{taking into account that the volume of the samples, at sea level, will be lower, }\DIFaddend the sampling time \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{may }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{will }\DIFaddend be longer and the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{airflow intake rate may be higher.

%DIF > However, considering the fact that the pump will not have the same efficiency at higher altitudes, the sampling time may be longer and the airflow intake rate may be higher. The exact numbers will be included in the upcoming version of the SED.  
}\DIFaddend 

For a 500 m of vertical displacement, the horizontal resolution of the AAC has been approximated based on past BEXUS flights data obtained from the BEXUS manual \cite{BexusManual}. The average horizontal resolution obtained for Ascent Phase is 588m and for Descent Phase is 186.5 m. This means that the square area covered by the sample will be 500 m x 588 m and 500 m x 186.5 m for ascent and Descent Phases respectively.

It is expected that the AAC will serve as model enabling a cost-effective large scale deployment scheme for regular high altitude greenhouse gas measurement. Unlike CAC, the design of AAC will not impose experimental restrictions based on the proximity of infrastructure for shipping and analysis. As such, a successful proof of concept of AAC sampling system will serve as a basis to enable reliable cost-effective measurements in remote areas.

    \item Funding research and outreach.
    \item Identifying team member strengths as well as weaknesses and assigning responsibilities accordingly without neglecting the opportunities to improve on weaknesses. 
    \item Do not assume cross-division communication will take place without organizing/planning it.
    \item Reviewing progress of assigned task should be continuous rather than waiting for their due dates.
    \item Agree on and clearly communicate to the team definition of \enquote{Done} when referring to tasks being completed.
    \item Agree on and clearly communicate to the team the definition of \enquote{Final Version} when referring to schematics, diagrams, and component lists.
    \item The lessons learned section of previous BEXUS SEDs is an invaluable resource that answers many BEXUS related recurring questions.
    \item If changes in management are required it is important that there is a sufficiently long change over period to allow a transfer of knowledge.
    \item Tasks that are not completed on time or were simply not worked on during the assigned time will impact projected deadlines and these situations must be planned for and mitigated against. An early red flag for this is if the reported team working hours tend to be lower than expected at which point one can expect to have to make up those hours up before a deadline. These concerns must continuously be communicated to the team.
    \item The REXUS/BEXUS programme is a significant investment in time and resources from all programme partners and as such the unique opportunity is not limited to participating students but to component manufacturers and suppliers as well. With this in mind, the team should not shy away from aggressively seeking funds or sponsorships from component manufacturers and suppliers as they stand to benefit from such a partnership to show case the robustness of their products.
    \DIFaddbegin \item \DIFadd{Testing will always take longer than expected and so time must be planned to account for this.
    }\item \DIFadd{When working with many remote team members extra time must be allowed for tasks to be completed as the communication is slower. Internal earlier deadlines help a lot.
    }\item \DIFadd{During manufacture and test having many smaller deadlines has proven useful in ensuring things stick to the time plan.
}\DIFaddend \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Scientific Division}
After an extended research in trace gases and climate change, as well as in atmospheric sampling methods, the science team has gained so far: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item General knowledge in climate change.
    \item General knowledge in the different sampling methods of the atmosphere; its characteristics and applications.
    \item Study scientific papers in detail.
    \item Outreach to scientific community.
    \item Translating scientific concepts to technical teams.
    \item Knowledge of how to design the scientific requirements in such a way that are in the permitted limits of the budget while the technical requirements are fulfilled.   
    \item How to sufficiently distribute the tasks within the science team and keep good communication with the other departments. 
    \item Experience, that writing down the tasks that need to be done, and keep tracking on them is better rather than having them as goals.   
    \item Knowledge in data analysis procedure and how to extract the desired results from raw data.
    \DIFaddbegin \item \DIFadd{Experience in producing a presentation only with the key points of a project and presenting it in front of other people.
    }\item \DIFadd{Work as a group from different locations.
    }\item \DIFadd{The importance of testing, and how to sufficiently deal with problems that come up unexpectedly.
     }

\DIFaddend \end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Electrical Division}
The electrical team has enhanced its understanding of the electronics design as well as gained confidence in selecting appropriate components as per requirements. Some of the points team improved as their general understanding are listed below:  
\begin{itemize}

    \item Gained confidence in designing electronics circuitry.
    \item Familiarized with the selection of the electrical components. 
    \item By reading through large number of data sheets, team is now able to easily extract and understand technical details. 
    \item Learned and developed power calculation skills.
    \item Got experience of using the Eagle software and how to find and make the libraries, footprints, and schematics for the required components.
    \item How to test the components in the vacuum chamber.
    \item Learned about the different connectors, wires and how to place the components on the PCB so the actual design can fit into the experiment box.
    \item Discovered the cascading consequences of changing one component.
    \item Finding how having big sheets with a lot of information can be preferable to several sheets with less specification.
    \DIFaddbegin \item \DIFadd{While designing PCB's with Eagle it's a good idea to draw the traces manually rather than using autotracer. Since it allows you double check your schematics while pulling the traces.
    }\item \DIFadd{When using netnaming to design schematics for later PCB designs in Eagle it's very important to triple check the net names since they sometimes change in unexpected ways.
    }\item \DIFadd{Got practical experience of soldering the different types of sensors, wires and connectors. 
    }\item \DIFadd{Learned how to sold SMD miniature pressure sensors onto the PCB.
    }\item \DIFadd{Familiarized with using work shop tools and machinery.
    }

\section{Outreach} \label{sec:appE}

\subsection{Outreach on Project Website}

To increase the projects out reach the TUBULAR Team created a project website. On the website there are descriptions of the project, a link to download the latest SED, information on the TUBULAR Team members and sponsors and a contact link. In addition the microblogging carried out by the TUBULAR Team is also displayed on the website.

The current critical path starts with ordering and receiving parts, until this is done building cannot take place. The key components are the pump, valves, tubing, fittings and Arduino. Once orders have been received building can take place and then testing can begin. All remaining tests require some degree of building to be completed. Certain tests such as Test 17 in Table \ref{tab:samples-condensation-test} require the entire pneumatic system to be completed and others such as Test 2 in Table \ref{tab:data-coll-test} require just the electronics and software.

In this time frame there are two periods with particularly low team availability; The early summer and early August. The work has been planned so that the critical work will be completed in the periods with higher availability. In the event that the work takes longer than expected the question marks can become green.

\section{Air Sampling Model for BEXUS Flight}\label{sec:appH}


\subsection{Introduction}

% que es aixo? simulation software for ascent and Descent Phases

\subsubsection{Objectives}

The purpose of this is to theoretically simulate the experiment; its preparation, the sampling methodology, and the expected results.

\subsubsection{Justification}
% why?
% The air sample volume is limited, how it should be distributed over the altitude?
% How many bags do we need?
% When we will open and close each bag?
% How big the bags should be?
% many parameter changing over the altitude and time: gondola velocity, air pressure and density (required sampling volume), pump efficiency (sampling time)
% parameter to control: bags resolution (Tubular number??)

This theoretical model will give an estimation of the time needed to fill the bags in order to achieve the best resolution, the required volume of the samples at the different altitudes, to make sure that there is enough sample left for analysis, the sampling altitudes and the number of the bags.  

\subsubsection{Methodology}
% how?
% context study, critical scenarios identification, equations, matlab simulation, verification with empirical measures.

For this purpose, a mathematical model was created using MATLAB. In order to make sure that this model is reliable, it is going to be tested for the atmospheric conditions in the Arctic, and then compared with the 1976 US Standard atmosphere model that is used for this region. What is more, the model will be compared with past BEXUS flight data. The goal of the model is to be as close as possible with these past data. 
After the tests, and making sure that the mathematical model is accurate, it will be adjusted with the TUBULAR's experiment requirements. In this way, the TUBULAR Team will get a general picture of the experiment's layout. Hence, the results of the experiment will be more or less expected, and in the case of complications, the mathematical model will be used as a reference of understanding what went wrong.


\subsection{Scientific and Empirical Background}

\subsubsection{Study of Previous BEXUS Flights}
This section has been elaborated based on the flight data files located in the previous BEXUS flights folders in the REXUS/BEXUS teamsite. This data was recorded by the Esrange Balloon Service System (EBASS).

\smallskip
This unit is responsible of the piloting of the balloon is done by Esrange. It provides the communication link between the gondola and the ground station. The EBASS airborne unit, receives the data from the on board sensors, and then it sends them to the EBASS ground unit. It is also responsible for the payload control, providing functions like the altitude control, by valve and ballast release or the flight termination. What is more, EBASS keeps track of the filght trajectory with an on-board GPS system.

\smallskip
Tables \ref{table:pre-flight} and \ref{table:post-flight} below gather some general information before and after the BEXUS flights. The pre-flight and the post-flight data are more or less in agreement in estimating for example, the ascent/descent time, the cut-off altitude and the float time. Knowing those information and that the estimations are close enough to the real data, will help the TUBULAR Team to define the experiment's parameters with higher accuracy. 

\smallskip
It is worth mentioning that the ascent speed in Table \ref{table:post-flight} is lower than the predicted $5\sim 6 m/s$ which is mentioned in the BEXUS manual. That is because it is the average velocity value of all the data points.

\end{table}

In order to find out how many bags it is possible to sample during Ascent and Descent Phase it is important to know the time duration of each phase i.e Ascent, Floating and Descent. For that reason, Figure \ref{fig:trajectories} provides some sights on how previous BEXUS flights perform and what we can expect from BEXUS 26.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Altitude Over Flight Time for BEXUS Flights 20,21,22,23,24 and 25.}\label{fig:trajectories}
\end{figure}

%\subsubsubsection{Gondola Dynamics}
\textbf{Gondola Dynamics}

The velocity of the gondola at each phase can give us information about its dynamics. For example, the data from the BEXUS flight 22 was chosen for analysis in order to get an idea of the velocity values and fluctuations throughout the flight. The obtained diagrams, with some marked points showing the time it takes for the gondola to reach a certain altitude, or the velocity of the gondola at a specific altitude, are shown below.   

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{align*}
    \noindent\makebox[\textwidth]{%

    \end{align*}
    \caption{Altitude Profile [Up] and Vertical Velocity Profile [Down] Over the Flight Time During BEXUS 22 Flight.}\label{fig:altitudevelocity}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:velocity} below, illustrates the velocity changes throughout the different phases.It works like a combination of both graphics form previous Figure \ref{fig:altitudevelocity}, however it provides a better representation of the velocity values at each phase. Especially during the Descent Phase, which is the most determinant for the air sampling process.

\smallskip
For each altitude, there are two velocity values, one for the Ascent and one for the Descent Phase. Constant and positive velocities indicate the Ascent Phase. During Ascent Phase the velocity is 6 m/s and almost constant, in agreement with the ascent speed value in the BEXUS manual. A zero velocity value indicates the Float Phase. Then the velocity becomes negative which indicates the Descent Phase. Once again, the velocity value close to the ground is 8 m/s as mentioned in the BEXUS manual\cite{BexusManual}.

\underline{Atmospheric Conditions}

\smallskip
In order to see how the atmospheric conditions change during a BEXUS flight, the data from the BEXUS flight 22 was chosen for analysis. Figure \ref{fig:atmosphericconditions} below shows which kind of information is available for different parameters such as the temperature, the pressure and the air density with altitude.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Variations in Temperature, Pressure and Air Density During the Ascent and Descent Phase  for BEXUS Flight 22.}\label{fig:atmosphericconditions}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Trace Gases Distribution}\label{tracegases}

Atmospheric greenhouse gases are mostly concentrated in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The Arctic region is of significant importance since there is where the maximum concentration of greenhouse gases is found due to meridional circulation (temperature differences) that pushes the gases from the equatorial to higher latitudes. Figures \ref{fig:carbondistribution} and \ref{fig:methanedistribution} are showing the concentration over latitude of two of the main greenhouse gases, $CO_2$ and $CH_4$ respectively.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{align*}
    \noindent\makebox[\textwidth]{%
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{appendix/img/carbondistribution.png}}
    \end{align*}
    \caption{Global Distribution of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide\cite{latitude}.}\label{fig:carbondistribution}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{align*}

    \end{align*}
    \caption{Global Distribution of Atmospheric Methane\cite{latitude}.}\label{fig:methanedistribution}
\end{figure}


The same applies for the vertical distribution of atmospheric greenhouse gases. The favoured altitudes for higher concentrations are the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere due to gravity waves and the vertical wind, which carry the trace gases at higher altitudes. What is more, $CO_2$ has longer lifetime in the troposphere and stratosphere, where it has essentially no sources or sinks since it is basically chemically inert in the free troposphere.

\smallskip
Figure \ref{fig:verticalco2} shows the global distribution of carbon dioxide in the upper troposphere-stratosphere, at 50-60\degree N for the time period 2000-2010. 

\smallskip
Figure \ref{fig:seasonal} shows the global distribution of the seasonal cycle of the monthly mean $CO_2$ (in ppmv) in the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere for the even months of 2010 and the altitude range from 5-45 $Km$. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{align*}
    \makebox[\textwidth]{%
        \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{appendix/img/verticaldistributionco2.png}}
    \end{align*}
    \caption{Global Distribution of $CO_2$ in the Upper Troposphere-Stratosphere\cite{CO2distribution}.}\label{fig:verticalco2}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Global Distribution of the Seasonal Cycle of the Monthly Mean $CO_2$ (in ppm) in the Upper Troposphere and the Lower Stratosphere for the Even Months of 2010\cite{CO2distribution}.}\label{fig:seasonal}
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{fig:verticalco2}, and \ref{fig:seasonal}, indicate that the higher $CO_2$ concentrations are found between 5 and 25 $km$ with peaks around 10 to 15 $km$ (figure \ref{fig:verticalco2}) and 20 $km$ for October (figure \ref{fig:seasonal}).

\smallskip
Figures \ref{fig:profile-olivier-membrive} and \ref{fig:profile-lisa} focus more on the region near the Arctic Circle. These figures represent vertical profiles distribution of $CO$, $CO_2$ and $CH_4$ extracted from past research papers \cite{LISA} \cite{Membrive}. The range of altitudes that will be compared is the one between 10 and 25 km. Since Figure \ref{fig:profile-olivier-membrive} vertical axis is in pressure, the equivalent pressures for these altitudes will be from approximately 200 hPa to 20 hPa. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item $CH_4$ distribution: There is a good agreement between both researches that the concentration around 10 km of altitude is about 1800 ppb and then it starts decreasing gradually with altitude. This decrease seems to be faster above 17 km (~70 hPa) which would make this the region of major interest. 
    \item $CO_2$ distribution: The concentration around 10 km is approximately 390-400 ppm in both researches. The biggest variation in concentration can be found between 10-17 km. The concentration of $CO_2$ seems to have an increase and then decrease again so this would be the most interesting range to sample. 
    \item $CO$ distribution: Only one research with CO profiles has been presented here so it cannot be compared with other researches. Analysing the only CO profile, it seems that the largest variation lays on the range 10-15 km, which should be the area of interest. 
\end{itemize}

Based on the vertical distribution profiles obtained from past researches, seems that our experiment should focus on sampling between 10-15 km for $CO$ and $CO_2$ but above 17 km for $CH_4$.

\subsection{Sampling Flowrate}
% \subsubsection{Pressure-Drop Flowrate}

%Air viscosity at ambient temperature (25ÂºC) and atmospheric pressure (1 atm = 101325 Pa) is about $10^-5$. This value decreases with the temperature and also with the pressure, which means that it is negligible in Artic conditions provided by Esrange location and specially in high altitudes. 

\subsubsection{Pump Efficiency}

%The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) and the US Standard Atmosphere 1976 are pretty much in agreement with some differences in the temperature distribution at higher altitudes.
%In the International Standard Atmosphere model, air is assumed to be dry, clean and to have constant composition. The function limitation of this is that does not take into account humidity effects or differences in pressure due to wind.

\smallskip
In this section, the data from the past BEXUS flights is compared with the 1976 US Standard Atmosphere, for validation reasons. Figure \ref{fig:pressure22} compares the changes in pressure over altitude for the BEXUS flights with the atmospheric model. It can be seen that the flights data-sets are in good agreement with the atmospheric model.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:temperature22} below shows the changes in temperature over altitude, for all the BEXUS flights with the atmospheric model. It can be seen that there is a quite large deviation of the temperature above $20 km$ of altitude between the BEXUS flights and the US Standard Atmosphere 1976 model. This is not arbitrary since it appears in all flights. But it is not surprising either, because most of the atmospheric models fail to precisely predict the temperatures at higher altitudes.

Again, in this section, the trajectories of past BEXUS flights, were compared with the mathematical model for validation reasons as shown in Figure \ref{fig:bexustrajectories}. Overall, BEXUS flights 20, 23 and 24 are in good agreement with the mathematical model. Some deviations exist between the mathematical model and the BEXUS flights 21 and 22 mostly in the last $5 km$ of the flight.

\subsubsection{Mass Effects in the Descent Curve}

Figure \ref{fig:masseffects}, shows how the descent time changes with different gondola mass values, after the cut-off phase. The heavier the payload, the sooner it will land. For example, if the gondola weights $250 kg$, it will land in approximately $25$ minutes after the cutoff, while it would take approximately $40$ minutes to land if it weights $100 kg$.

\subsubsection{Discrete Sampling Volumes}

Figure \ref{fig:samplingvolume} supports the TUBULAR Team's decision to use a pump if sampling at high altitudes is meant, even though there is a single point failure risk. At \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$20 km$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend of altitude, the minimum amount of air that would be needed to be sampled, in order to ensure that there is enough left for analysis at ground, would be \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{almost \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$3 L$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$2.4 L$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . Considering the low pressure at this high altitude, and the time it would be needed to fill the bag, it would be impossible to fulfill the experiment's objectives without using a pump. Moreover, without a pump, sampling at altitudes higher than $22 km$, and also during Ascent Phase, would be impossible.

The obtained diagrams below, show that even if the sampling starts at $26 km$, or at $30 km$, or at $40 km$, the number of filled bags would still be the same. This happens, due to the low pressure conditions at such altitudes which not allow a faster filling of a bag, and specially the low air density which forces to sample much more volume of air. Of course, the number of bags that can be filled, depends on the pump's efficiency at high altitudes.  So, the altitude of the gondola's cut-off over about $26 km$ would not affect the experiment's outcome.

\smallskip
Since the experiment uses a single pump, it is not possible to sample more than one bags at the same time. For the above hypothetical case, the maximum number of filled bags was five, considering continuous sampling. However, this is not the case when it comes to real life. Before sampling a bag, the system has to be flushed. Then, the sampling of a bag begins. After filling one bag, the system has to be flushed again before starting sampling a second bag. In that case, filling five bags, according to the hypothetical scenario, would be practically impossible.

\subsubsection{Sampling Strategy}

After testing the pump at low pressure environment, an overall idea about the performance of the pump at high altitudes is now known and an approximation of the sampling strategy is possible.   
The total weight of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{gondola is not known yet, but }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{BEXUS 26 gondola is approximated to be 266.55 kg, and }\DIFaddend the balloon is expected to reach \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{25-27 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{25.8 }\DIFaddend km altitude, following \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{almost }\DIFaddend the trajectory of the BEXUS 24 flight as shown in figure \ref{fig:bexustrajectories}. 
This serves the objectives of the TUBULAR experiment since, as indicated in Section \ref{tracegases} the altitudes with higher differences in trace gases concentrations, are between 10 and 25 km. These are the altitudes where the sampling will be done. Sampling six bags in total, is enough to fulfil the objectives of the experiment and it is also feasible. Two bags will be sampled during Ascent Phase and four during Descent Phase. The ascent speed of the gondola, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:altitudevelocity}, is estimated to be \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{6 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{5 }\DIFaddend m/s. A velocity of this rate, makes sampling of two bags possible while achieving a good resolution. It is important to mention here that the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pressure inside the }\DIFaddend two bags that will be sampled during Ascent Phase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, shall not be fully filled, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{shall not exceed 140 hPa }\DIFaddend since their volume will increase with decreasing pressure and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{may burst. For that reason, only about 80\% of their volume will be filled. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{they could burst. }\DIFaddend On the other hand, during Descent Phase the four remaining bags shall be filled with the full 3 L. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Since }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This is because }\DIFaddend their volume will decrease with increasing pressure \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend it has to be made sure that there will be enough sample left for analysis. 

The sampling of the first bag will start at 18 km of altitude. The \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{minimum }\DIFaddend sampling time is estimated to be \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{44s }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{29s }\DIFaddend with an achieved resolution of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{262m}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{143m}\DIFaddend . The second bag will be sampled at 21 km of altitude, and it will take \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{47 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{43 }\DIFaddend s to fill the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{minimum }\DIFaddend desired volume of air, with a resolution of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{279 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{214 }\DIFaddend m. Before sampling, flushing of the AAC system for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1min is taking }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{one minute is taken }\DIFaddend into account. During that, the gondola will cover a distance of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{360 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{300 }\DIFaddend m. 

During Descent Phase \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and considering a descent speed of 8 m/s}\DIFaddend , the sampling of the third \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{bag }\DIFaddend will start from 17.5 km. The \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{minimum }\DIFaddend sampling time is estimated to be \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{52.94 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{27 }\DIFaddend sec with a resolution of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{423.53 m. Bag no 4 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{216.5 m. The fourth bag }\DIFaddend will be sampled at 16 km for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{50.0 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{at least 20 }\DIFaddend s and resolution of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{400 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{156 }\DIFaddend m. The fifth bag will be sampled at 14 km for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{47.37 s }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{14.3 s minimum }\DIFaddend and resolution of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{378.95 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{115 }\DIFaddend m. The sample of the last bag will start at 12 km for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{40.91 s }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{9 s minimum }\DIFaddend sampling time and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{327.27 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{71 }\DIFaddend m resolution. Again, one minute of flushing is taken into account, in between the sampling of each bag.

The flow rates of the pump, at each sampling altitude were taken from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Figure \ref{fig:pump-performance}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Table \ref{tab:normal-flow-rates}}\DIFaddend .




%Figure \ref{fig:samplingvolume} shows the minimum amount of air that needs to be sampled at each altitude in order to have enough left for analysis on ground. At 17 km the volume needed is approximately 2.5L. So, it would take 150 seconds and 900m to sample the first bag. Starting the sampling of the second bag at 18km, it would take 156sec and 936m to fill it with the minimum volume of air, approximately 2.6L. For the third bag, starting the sampling from 20 km it would take 168 second and 1.008 km to sample 2.8 L of air. The last bag would need 300 second and 1.8km to sample almost 5 L of air, starting from 22 km. In total, with one minute of flushing before each sampling of a bag, is 1014 seconds or 28 minutes.

\subsubsection{Discusion of the Results}
Overall, the mathematical model is in good agreement with the data from the past BEXUS flights as well as, with the atmospheric model used for the Arctic region.
Making this document, helped the TUBULAR Team to cross-check some theoretical values, important for the layout and the planning of the experiment. Tables \ref{table:pre-flight} and \ref{table:post-flight} show that the estimated data before each flight are pretty close with the real data obtained by the flights which \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will help }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{helped }\DIFaddend the TUBULAR Team to define the experiment's parameters with higher accuracy. 
In order to make a sampling plan, it is important to know the duration time of each phase. Figure \ref{fig:trajectories}, shows the trajectories of the different BEXUS flights, giving the TUBULAR Team a general idea of what the trajectory of the flight can look like and how the duration of each phase changes regarding the maximum altitude that the gondola reaches.

The velocity profile, Figure \ref{fig:velocity}, is of high importance since the velocity during \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ascent }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Ascent }\DIFaddend and Descent Phase, will determine the resolution of the samples. In general, the velocity values are in agreement with the BEXUS manual, with an ascent speed of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{6 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{5 }\DIFaddend m/s and a descent speed, fluctuating after cutoff, before stabilizing at 8 m/s at the last kilometers of the flight. Another important thing that has to be mentioned here, is the TUBULAR Team's decision to sample during Ascent Phase too and not only during Descent Phase. As seen in figure \ref{fig:velocity} the gondola is turbulent after the cutoff with velocities up to 83 m/s, and needs more or less 6 km before stabilizing its velocity as figure \ref{fig:altitudevelocity} indicates. Hence, the altitudes that the gondola will be turbulent, will be covered by sampling during Ascent Phase. This will not affect the comparison with the CAC that will be sampled during Descent Phase only, since the horizontal displacement of the gondola is much smaller than the vertical. 

Atmospheric conditions play a crucial role for the TUBULAR experiment. The TUBULAR Team should know, the different pressures at each altitude, since the pressure is the parameter that will trigger the sampling of the bags. What is more, the pressure will determine the performance of the pump and it is crucial to know under what pressures the pump needs to be tested depending on the sample altitude. The temperature is of high importance too and the trickier to predict especially at high altitudes. The TUBULAR Team should be able to keep the temperature of the pump within its working temperature range in order to assure that the pump will start working. To do so, the air temperature must be known at each altitude which will help the TUBULAR Team to come up with a good thermal plan. 

The sampling altitude range will not be chosen randomly. The idea is to find the altitude range, where the trace gases show the bigger differences in concentration. In Section \ref{tracegases}, were presented some theoretical trace gases concentration values as well as, some results from past research papers. According to them, the more interesting area to sample is between 10 and 25 km of altitude. The TUBULAR Team, plans to sample between 17 and 22 km during Ascent Phase and 17 to 10 km during Descent Phase. 

Additionally, the sampling software revealed some limitations of the sampling system and also which parameters should be taken into account for the experiment's layout and which not. 
The weight of the gondola, will affect the maximum altitude that the balloon will reach, and the time needed for the gondola to land, but it doesn't contribute to the decision of how many bags will be used.

The decision of the TUBULAR Team to use a pump was questioned at the beginning, as a single point failure risk. However, this decision is justified by the need of sampling during Ascent Phase, ohterwise the sampling would not be \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{possile}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{possible}\DIFaddend .  Figure \ref{fig:samplingvolume}, supports the use of a pump because without a pump, sampling at 22 km of altitude, would be impossible considering the low pressure and the time it would take to fill a bag. 

Note that even with the pump, some limitations still exist. The sampling of the bags cannot be continuous since the system has to be flushed before sampling a bag. Furthermore, the flow rate of the pump will be lower at high altitudes than it is on the ground, due to pressure differences. Figure \ref{fig:limits} points out that even with an ideal flow rate of 1 L/min and sampling continuously, it is not possible to sample more than five bags, because it takes a lot of time to sample a bag at high altitude atmospheric conditions. Additionally, it makes clear why the maximum altitude that the gondola will reach, does not affect the experiment's outcome. As the gondola ascents, the pressure gets lower and takes more time to sample a bag. So, sampling more bags would not be possible even if the balloon reaches a higher altitude. The same applies for the Descent Phase and the cutoff altitude. 

Concluding, whilst at the beginning, the idea was to sample a total of sixteen bags in order to have more samples to compare with the continuous vertical profile obtained by the CAC, this document justifies that this is not feasible. Taking into account all the different parameters, it made clear which of them are important and which are not. Parameters like the gondola's velocity, the pressure at different altitudes, and the pump's flow rate, will determine the outcome of the TUBULAR experiment, the number of the bags that will be used, as well as the sampling altitudes. Parameters like the gondola's weight or the maximum altitude that the balloon will reach, does not affect the experiment's outcome and have a secondary role.

\subsection{Thermal calculations in MATLAB}
For the MATLAB calculations a few assumptions were made, they are as follows.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Taking the average of MATLAB calculations for calculations with or without sun.
    \item Calculate the average temperature on the outside wall of the experiment.
    \item Assuming the inner temperature at the bags section is uniform.
    \item The pipes letting cold air in have not been taken into account in MATLAB.
    \item Assume no interference between the two experiment boxes.
    \item All conduction is uniform from the inside.
    \item Assume steady flow through the walls from conduction.
    \item Assume radiation and convection from/on 6 walls not 5.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Solar flux and Albedo}
The albedo is the reflected solar flux from earth so it can be put into the same equation as the solar flux. It is assumed that the sun hit two sides of the experiment at a $45\degree$ angle at all time over 10 km. In the mid of October at the time for launch the sun will hit the experiment with a maximum inclination of $15\degree$ from the horizon.
\begin{equation*}
    Q_{Sun+Albedo} = \alpha_{Al}\cdot S \cdot cos(15) \cdot (A_{Sun} \cdot cos(45) + Albedo \cdot A_{Albedo})
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Conduction}
For calculating the outer walls temperature, the assumption of steady flow through walls is used.
\begin{equation*}
    Q_{Conduction} = [\text{Steady flow through wall}] = \text{Dissipated power} = P
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Earth IR flux}
The earth IR flux is the flux that comes from earth as a black body radiating. It is calculated from finding the IR flux at the ground then scale it to the altitude the experiment will fly at. The following equations were found from \cite{BalloonAscent}.
\begin{gather*}
    IR_{Ground} = \varepsilon_{earth} \cdot \sigma \cdot T_{ground}^4 \\
    \tau_{atmIR} = 1.716 - 0.5\cdot \Bigg[e^{-0.65\frac{P_{25km}}{P_{ground}}} + e^{-0.95\frac{P_{25km}}{P_{ground}}}\Bigg] \\
    IR_{25km} = \tau_{atmIR} \cdot IR_{Ground}
\end{gather*}
After the IR has been calculated for the floating altitude it is put into the following equation. 
\begin{equation*}
    Q_{IR} = \varepsilon_{earth} \cdot A_{IR} \cdot IR_{25km}
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Radiation}
It is assumed that the experiment will experience radiation from all 6 sides. In reality it will experience radiation from 5 sides because the CAC box will be in contact with one of the AAC box's sides. It was decided to leave it at 6 for the calculations in order to compensate for having no holes to let cold air in to the pump.
\begin{equation*}
    Q_{Radiation} = \sigma \cdot \varepsilon_{Al} \cdot A_{Radiation} \cdot (T_{Out}^4 - T_{Ambient}^4 )
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Convection}
At an altitude of 25 km there is far lower air density than at sea level. Therefore, it gives that a scaling factor $K$ has to be taken into account when calculating the convection and K can be seen in Table \ref{tab:heat-loss} for different altitudes.
\begin{equation*}
    Q_{Convection} = h \cdot K \cdot A_{Convection} \cdot (T_{Out} - T_{Ambient})
\end{equation*}

The equation for approximating the heat transfer coefficient for air is outlined as:
\begin{equation*}
h = 10.45 - v + 10\cdot\sqrt{v}
\end{equation*}
Where $v$ is the velocity of the fluid medium.

As the balloon is expected to rise at approximately $5 m/s$ for the duration of the Ascent Phase, the starting value for the convective heat transfer coefficient $h$ is expected to be $27.811$, assuming negligible wind currents perpendicular to the direction of ascent. %I will probably move this paragraph to our Thermal Design section, since this is important information.

The equations used to obtain the value of $K$ are listed below:

\begin{equation*}
F(T_{sea}, T_{alt}) = \big(\frac{k_{alt}}{k_{sea}}\big)^{1-n}\times \Big[\Big(\frac{\beta_{alt}}{\beta_{sea}}\Big)\times \Big(\frac{\mu_{sea}}{\mu_{alt}}\Big)\times \Big(\frac{c_{p-alt}}{c_{p-sea}}\Big)\times \Big(\frac{\rho(T_{alt})}{\rho(T_{sea})}\Big)^{2}\Big]^{n}
\end{equation*}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $n$ is an exponent value dependent on the turbulence of the fluid medium ($\frac{1}{4}$ for laminar flow and $\frac{1}{3}$ for turbulent flow)
    \item $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the air
    \item $\beta$ is the thermal expansion coefficient for air
    \item $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the air
    \item $c_{p}$ is the specific heat capacity of the air at constant pressure
    \item $\rho(T)$ is the density of the air as a function of only temperature difference (i.e. for constant pressure)
    \item "sea" denotes the current variable is represented by its value found at sea level
    \item "alt" denotes the current variable is represented by its value found at a specified altitude
\end{itemize}


The values for $F$ from this equation were then applied to its respective position in the following equation to determine the ratio between the convective heat transfer coefficient $h$ at sea level (assumed to have negligible differences for Esrange ground level) and the same coefficient at a specified altitude:

\begin{equation*}
K = \Big(\frac{\rho(P_{alt})}{\rho(P_{sea})}\Big)^{2n}\times \Big(\frac{\Delta T_{air}}{\Delta T_{sea}}\Big)^{n}\times F(T_{sea}, T_{alt})
\end{equation*}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\rho(T)$ is the density of the air as a function of only temperature difference (i.e. for constant pressure)
    \item $\delta T$ is the difference between the temperature of the ambient air and the surface in question
\end{itemize} \\


%Table for convective and radiative heat loss will go here.

Table \ref{tab:heat-loss} combines the previously listed convection and radiation formulae integrated into the MATLAB scripts to determine the convective and radiative heat loss in the worst case for (highest) power dissipation during each stage of the experiment. Additional information on the thermodynamics of the atmosphere was obtained from \textit{Engineering Toolbox} \cite{EngTool} \\

\subsubsection{Thermal equation}
If there is no sun on the experiment.
\begin{gather*}
    Q_{IR} + Q_{Conduction} = Q_{Radiation} + Q_{Convection} \\
    \updownarrow \\
    \varepsilon_{earth} \cdot A_{IR} \cdot IR_{25km} + P \\ = \sigma \cdot \varepsilon_{Al} \cdot A_{Radiation} \cdot (T_{Out}^4 - T_{Ambient}^4 ) + h \cdot K \cdot A_{Convection} \cdot (T_{Out} - T_{Ambient})
\end{gather*}
If there is sun on the experiment it is the same but adding $Q_{Sun+Albedo}$.
\begin{gather*}
    Q_{IR} + Q_{Conduction} + Q_{Sun+Albedo} = Q_{Radiation} + Q_{Convection} \\
    \updownarrow \\
    \varepsilon_{earth} \cdot A_{IR} \cdot IR_{25km} + P + \alpha_{Al}\cdot S \cdot cos(15) \cdot (A_{Sun} \cdot cos(45) + Albedo \cdot A_{Albedo}) \\ = \sigma \cdot \varepsilon_{Al} \cdot A_{Radiation} \cdot (T_{Out}^4 - T_{Ambient}^4 ) + h \cdot K \cdot A_{Convection} \cdot (T_{Out} - T_{Ambient})
\end{gather*}
From those equations $T_{Out}$ can be calculated and it is the average temperature on the aluminum sheets facing the outside air.
After $T_{Out}$ have been found the inner temperature can be calculated by using heat transfer through the wall.
\begin{gather*}
    P = \frac{T_{Inside} - T_{Outside}}{A \cdot (\frac{L_{Al}}{k_{Al}} + \frac{L_{PS}}{k_{PS}})} \\
     \updownarrow \\
    T_{Inside} = P \cdot A \cdot (\frac{L_{Al}}{k_{Al}} + \frac{L_{PS}}{k_{PS}}) + T_{Outside}
\end{gather*}
$T_{Inside}$ is then assumed to be the uniform air temperature in the experiment.



\subsubsection{Trial run with BEXUS 25 air temperature data for altitudes}
The air temperature data varying over altitude from old BEXUS flight could be found on the REXUS/BEXUS website. To do a simulated test flight for the calculations done in MATLAB, to see how it would be for a real flight it was calculated and plotted in with data from BEXUS 25 flight. 
Because of there being approx 42000 data points it had to be scaled down and only every $25^{th}$ data point was used to save time and there was not much detail loss by taking every $25^{th}$. In Figure \ref{fig:thermal-testflight-AAC} the TUBULAR test flight is the uniform temperature on the inside with a insulation consisting as specified in Table \ref{tab:Wall-thickness-AAC-CAC}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{align*}
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{appendix/img/Thermal/AAC-test-flight.jpg}
    \end{align*}
    \caption{Simulated Test Flight of TUBULAR AAC Box with Data From BEXUS 25.}
    \label{fig:thermal-testflight-AAC}
\end{figure}
When the data was found it was checked in ANSYS to determine and add heaters to control the most critical parts of the model.

\subsubsection{Trial flight for the CAC} \label{sssec:CAC-trial-flight}
The CAC box does not require as much thermal design as the AAC box. The only part to consider is the valve, which has a lower limit of the operating temperature of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$-10\degree C$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$-10\degree{ C}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . It will not be a problem because the valve will open a little before launch and have a current throughout the whole flight heating it self up. If the thermal analysis is proven wrong by a test, showing that it is not sufficient to use only self heating, a heater can be applied at a later date. The passive thermal design for the CAC box will consist of aluminum sheets and Styrofoam as specified in \ref{tab:Wall-thickness-AAC-CAC}.

    \label{fig:thermal-testflight-CAC}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{MATLAB Conclusion}
By running the MATLAB script, the hottest and coldest case for $0.02 m$ on the wall and $0.03 m$ on the top and bottom of the Styrofoam could be found for ascent and descent sampling. The thermal conductivity of Styrofoam is $k=0.03$. In Table \ref{tab:temperature-sampling-ascent-descent} it is shown the hottest and coldest case of temperature on the inside when samples should be taken. The hottest and coldest cases are taken from Figure \ref{fig:thermal-testflight-AAC}.

\subsection{Thermal Simulations in ANSYS}
In ANSYS, FEA simulations were done using both Steady-State Thermal and Transient Thermal analysis.
Because of the limitations in ANSYS student license a simplified model has been used, which can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:Ansys-CAD-model}. It is in a lower corner of the experiment showing the Brain and has three walls to the sampling bags and the air is uniform on the inside. The uniform inside air can be taken from the data from the test flight in Figure (\ref{fig:thermal-testflight-AAC}). These simulations were done to see what temperature the pump and manifolds will be as they are the most critical components.

    \end{align*}
    \caption{The CAD Model Used for ANSYS Simulations}
    \label{fig:Ansys-CAD-model}
\end{figure}

The CAD model is as seen in the figure \ref{fig:Ansys-CAD-model}. The side exterior walls are $0.02 m$, the interior walls of the Brain to the bags are $0.03 m$ and the top and bottom wall consist of $0.03 m$ Styrofoam as well. The outer parts of the pipes are set to stainless steel with a constant temperature (the same as the ambient outside). The tubes closest to the pump and the one going from pump to the manifold were set to air to simulate and be able to vary depending on the temperature outside and the pump heating up from the heater.

A transient thermal analysis was also performed by simulating a test flight with data from BEXUS 25 using results from MATLAB. It was performed so the thickness of the wall could be verified to see if it was good enough and whether adding heaters was required. By being flexible with adding heaters, moving them around, changing their strength and their on time, it is possible to enable the pump and the manifold to operate in their required temperature ranges.

\subsection{Result}
The main objective from performing first the MATLAB calculations and then the ANSYS simulations has been to iterate and find the wall thickness of Styrofoam between the Brain and the inside of the AAC box. The next objective was to iterate the design with adding heaters to find the required amount and find approximately how long they need to run. By running a transient thermal analysis for the test flight there was the possibility to simulate heaters that will be on and off to determine how strong they need to be.

The results from the ANSYS simulations assumed a worst case scenario. It was to be expected that the results were not fully accurate, and instead were slightly warmer in reality. The worst case is with air inside at normal density. In reality when it is time to sample (at 17km), the air density will be less then 15\% of the air density at sea level \cite{EngToolair}. It means there will be less heat loss from components to the air inside the brain. Figures \ref{fig:Pump-Valve-ascent-sample} and \ref{fig:Pump-Valve-ascent-sample-descent} show that the temperature of the pump is above \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$5\degree C$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$5\degree{C}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend and the manifold is above \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$-10\degree C$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$-10\degree{C}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . It is only during a portion of the Ascent Phase, just prior to the start of sampling that the heater should be on in order for the pump to be above \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$5\degree C$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$5\degree{C}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , and it shall only be needed to be on during this Phase. By having a heater on the flushing valve and the manifold it is possible to get all the valves to the operating temperature. The flushing tube that goes out to the open air outside will cool down the flushing valve so adding a heater there to compensate is required. When it is time to flush right before sample can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:flushing-valve}. The manifold would still need a heater because it will be affected by the cold outer air and help heat up all the components

The insulation for the AAC will be as specified in Table \ref{tab:Wall-thickness-AAC-CAC}. For the three inner walls between the Brain and the bags there will be a $0.03 m$ wall of Styrofoam. By using two $5\,W$ heaters for the pump, one on top and one on bottom side, a 5 W heater for the flushing valve and one for the manifold. The thermal simulations predict that they will be within the operating limits with a satisfactory margin. For the heater controller, it will be set that if the pump is below \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$15\degree\,C$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$15\degree{C}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend it will turn on. As for the flushing valve, the heater will be set to turn on if the flushing valve and manifold is below \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$-5 \degree\,C$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$-5 \degree{C}$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .

%The insulation elements will be attached to the rails and to each other through the use of glue as an adhesive. Due to its strength, glue can provide sufficiently strong bonds over small areas of contact between materials. This means only a handful of additional heat bridges to be factored and none of them particularly conductive. For remaining portions near the edges of each wall of insulation, the materials may be connected together with tape owing to its adhesive strength being similar to that of the glue. The tape would prevent convection (at the cost of slightly increased conduction at the points/edges of contact) at lower altitudes from occurring due to air flowing in between the otherwise exposed gaps between the Styrofoam, the aluminum sheets, and the rails. In the event that tape would not be a suitable candidate, the Styrofoam may be milled to match the groove profile of the supporting rails so that it may be fitted in between them directly - leaving the whole structure secure while only using glue for connecting the Styrofoam to the aluminum sheeting.

%The Styrofoam will be attached to the structure with thread. By attaching a thread to the 90 degree bracket reinforcements (seen in Figure \ref{fig:corner_bracket}) and then tie them together at the middle. Together with the aluminum sheet screwed into the structure it will make a slot to keep the Styrofoam in place so it can not move around. By having the thread tied in the middle it is possible tighten it up.

%Thread will be used to attache the styrofoam to the structure. It will loop around the 90 degree bracket reinforcements (seen in Figure \ref{fig:corner_bracket}) and its ends will be tied together in between them. Together with the aluminum sheet screwed into the structure, the thread will make a slot to keep the Styrofoam in place, keeping the styrofoam block held in place. By having the thread knot(s) in the middle it will be possible for the thread to be tightened to any degree necessary to prevent insulation instability.

\section{Test Results} \label{sec:apptestres}

\subsection{Test 28: Pump Operations}
\label{sec:test28result}

The pump was connected via crocodile connections to a power supply set to 24 V. The power supply was then switched on and the current was read off. This set-up can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:pump-testing}.

It was found that when the power supply was switched on the current went up to 600 mA for less than one second. It then settled to 250 mA. By covering the air intake, simulating air intake from a lower pressure, the current drops to 200 mA. By covering the air output, simulating pushing air into a higher pressure, the current rises to 400 mA.

Therefore the power for each of these conditions is 14.4 W at turn on, 6 W in normal use, 4.8 W when sucking from low pressure, 9.6 W when pushing to high pressure.


\begin{figure}[H]

    \end{align*}
    \caption{Photo Showing the Set-up for the Pump Testing in the Laboratory.} \label{fig:pump-testing}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Test 18: Pump Low Pressure}\label{subsection:pumplowpressuretest}

The pump was tested at low pressure using a small vacuum chamber that is capable of going down to \SI{1}{\hecto\pascal}. For this test the chamber was only taken down to \SI{30}{\hecto\pascal} as this is the expected pressure at 24 km, the highest altitude that will be sampled. The experiment set-up can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:pump-low-pressure-set-up}. The pump was connected to the power supply via two cables. It was also screwed into the base plate to prevent it from moving due to its own vibration during the test. A vacuum pump was connected to the chamber wall with a pressure sensor attached to monitor the pressure inside the chamber. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{align*}
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{5-experiment-verification-and-testing/img/low-pressure-set-up.png}
    \end{align*}
    \caption {Photo Showing the Set-up of the Vacuum Chamber, Power Supply and Vacuum Pump.}\label{fig:pump-low-pressure-set-up}
\end{figure}

The glass top and cage were then placed on top of the sampling bag and pump and the air slowly removed. Figure \ref{fig:pump-low-pressure-progress} shows the test as it was in progress. 

As the air was removed from the chamber a new problem became immediately obvious. Air that was inside the bag before the test was expanding as the pressure decreased until the bag reached around $75\%$ of its total volume. The air had been pushed out of the sampling bag before the test but this had not been completed thoroughly enough. Therefore care must be taken to ensure that there is no, or very very small amounts, of air inside the bag before it enters a low pressure environment. For subsequent tests the pump was used in reverse to suck any remaining air out of the bags. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{align*}
        \includegraphics[width=6cm]{5-experiment-verification-and-testing/img/low-pressure-in-progress.png}
    \end{align*}
    \caption {Photo Showing the Pump and Sampling Bag in the Vacuum Chamber During the Test.} \label{fig:pump-low-pressure-progress}
\end{figure}

Repeating the test and using the pump to suck out excess air from the bags the chamber was taken to around \SI{30}{\hecto\pascal}. Once the chamber was at this pressure the pump was switched on and a stopwatch began. Once the bag stopped inflating the stopwatch was stopped. During this test there was also a drop in pressure to \SI{28}{\hecto\pascal} and during a repeat there was a drop to \SI{25}{\hecto\pascal}. This also occurred in later tests. This is not seen as a significant problem as during the flight this is exactly what will happen when testing during ascent. In addition the flow rate increases with increasing outside pressure therefore this is showing our worst case flow rate. It was found that the pump was able to successfully switch on and fill the bag at this altitude with a flow rate of approximately 3 L/min. 

The test was repeated again at \SI{88}{\hecto\pascal}, representing 17 km altitude and \SI{220}{\hecto\pascal}, representing 11 km altitude. Here the flow rates were found to be 3.4 L/min and 4.9 L/min respectively. The results can also be seen in Table \ref{tab:pump-low-pressure-result} and Figure \ref{fig:pump-performance}.

\subsubsection{Test 30: Sampling Bag Bursting}
\label{sec:test30result}

A sampling bag was placed in a small vacuum chamber connected to the pump with the same set up as in Test 18, see Figures \ref{fig:pump-low-pressure-set-up} and \ref{fig:pump-low-pressure-progress}. The pump was run for 3 minutes with a full bag to see how the bag reacted. No changes were observed in the bag and no leaks appeared whilst it was in the testing chamber. Upon returning it to atmospheric levels it also appeared to be able to withstand the over pressure. The bag was then left, with the valve closed, on a table where it was handled a little during this time. Approximately 30 minutes after the test the bag made an audible popping noise and air leaked out. The damage that occurred to the bag during the burst can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:bag-burst-front} for the front of the bag and Figure \ref{fig:bag-burst-back} for the back of the bag.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption {Photo Showing the Extent of Damage on the Back of the Bag Due to Bursting.} \label{fig:bag-burst-back}
\end{figure}

This kind of bag failure could occur if bags are overfilled, particularly during ascent.

Next the system was set-up in the same way with a new bag. This time the pump was continuously run until failure occurred. This took around 6 minutes. The bag failed along the lower seam close to the valve and also at the valve connection. At the valve connection the bag ripped just above the valve. This time the burst was more energetic with the bottom of the bag moving outwards. Upon inspection the bottom of the bag was completely open and the part of the bag connected to the valve partially ripped open. In addition at the top of the bag small failures similar to those seen in Figure \ref{fig:bag-burst-front} were seen again. It is therefore thought that the bag was starting to fail at both the top and the bottom of the bag and but the bottom failed first.

The damage can be seen in Figures \ref{fig:seam-break} and \ref{fig:valve-rip}. It should be noted that the white bag valve was pulled off after the test and before photos were taken.

    \caption {Photo Showing Where the Bag Ripped Around the Valve.} \label{fig:valve-rip}
\end{figure}

This kind of bag failure could occur if there is a software error that results in the pump not switching off or a valve not closing, or if there is a malfunction in one of the valves which means it fails to close.

From the damage seen on the bags and from witnessing the burst it can be concluded that, as long as the bags are well secured to the valves at the bottom and through the metal ring at the top, bag bursting during flight would not cause damage to any other components on board. Even during the more energetic burst that occurs from continuous pumping the bag remained fixed to the valve connection and experienced no fragmentation. The consequences of a single bag burst would be limited to loss of data and a disturbance to audio frequencies. 

\subsection{Test 29: Pump Current under Low Pressure}
\label{sec:test29result}

This test was set up in the same way as above in Test 18, see Figure \ref{fig:pump-low-pressure-set-up} and \ref{fig:pump-low-pressure-progress}. The addition to this test was a multimeter to read the current that the pump was drawing. The pump was tested once with the outlet attached to a bag and once with the outlet sealed. This provides the current when the pump is pumping into an ambient pressure and into a higher pressure.

In general it was found for both cases that decreasing the pressure, or increasing the altitude, lead to a decrease in pump current draw. It was noted that there was an increase in current draw in between sea level conditions and 11 km altitude conditions. However as the lowest sampling point it intended to be at 11 km this should not be a problem for the experiment. The full results can be seen in Table \ref{tab:pumpcurrentpressure}. 

\begin{table}[H]
\centering

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Altitude (km)} & \textbf{Pressure (hPa)} & \textbf{Into Bag Current (mA)} & \textbf{Into Seal Current (mA)} \\ \hline

16 & 100 & 161 & 146 \\ \hline

6 & 500 & - & 242 \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{Table Showing How the Current Draw of the Pump Changed With Outside Air Pressure for Two Different Conditions. The First Pumping Into a Sampling Bag and the Second Pumping Into a Sealed Tube.}
\label{tab:pumpcurrentpressure}
\end{table}

A graphical representation of these results are shown in Figures \ref{fig:pumpcurpresbag} and \ref{fig:pumpcurpres}. From the table and figures it can be seen that the current draw is higher during the bag filling than during the sealed case. As the experiment will sample between 11 km and 24 km it can be concluded that the highest current draw will occur during the 11 km altitude sample and can be expected to be around 200 mA. 

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption {Graph Showing the Expected Current Values When the Pump is Pumping Air Into a Sealed Outlet Based Upon the Results Obtained and the Data Shown In Figure \ref{fig:pumpflowcur}.} \label{fig:pumpcurpres}
\end{figure}

By looking at the data from both Test 18 and Test 29 a relationship can be seen between the outside air pressure, the flow rate of the pump and the current draw of the pump. 

\subsection{Test 17: Sampling bags' holding times and samples' condensation verification}
\label{sec:test17result}

The main objective of this test was to flush eight 1 L sampling bags with nitrogen, the same way it will be done for the flight. After the flushing is done, fill them with a dry gas and leave them outside for 6, 14, 24 and 48 hours. Then analyze two sampling bags after each time duration and see if the concentration of gases inside has changed. 

A dry gas is a gas of high concentration of $CO$ and low $H_2O$ and its exact concentration can be known by comparison to the calibrating gas in the Picarro analyzer. Therefore, the concentration when sampling the bags is known and it can be compared with the concentration after analysis. If the sampling bags can hold the samples for 48 hours then when analyzing, the concentration of gases should not change. If condensation occurs that will be seen as an increase in water vapour concentration. 

Note that the size of the sampling bags was not the same as the size that will be used during the experiment. The reasons were availability of 1 L sampling bags at FMI and a first assumption that the size would not affect the results. The sampling bags were exactly the same model/material.


This test was realized at FMI in Sodankyl\"{a}. Eight Multi-Layer Foil bags of 1 L volume were connected to SMC valves as shown in Figure \ref{fig:bag-valve-quick-connector} and all together connected in series with stainless steel tubes as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:bags-test-set-up}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:bags-test-general-overview} shows a general overview of the experiment set up before the sampling bags were attached to the SMC valves. The picture shows the eight SMC valves hanging on a bar and red and black cables connecting them to the switches. It can also be seen a nitrogen bottle standing at the right side of the table and a vacuum pump under the table. Figure \ref{fig:nitrogen-vacuum-valve} shows the pressure sensor on the table, a flow-metre, a needle valve that adjusts the flow rate and a valve. This valve was used to control the filling and flushing of the sampling bags realized with nitrogen. The position shown in Figure \ref{fig:nitrogen-vacuum-valve} is for vacuuming, the pump is sucking the air from the sampling bags and the nitrogen tube is closed. The valve position for filling is the opposite, opening the nitrogen tube and closing the vacuum. There is also an intermediate position that closes both, nitrogen and vacuum.

The procedure during the test was as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Set up all the connections between pump, nitrogen bottle, valves system in series. 
    \item Attach the sampling bags to the SMC valves. 
    \item Start flushing the tubes with nitrogen. For this all the sampling bags' valves are closed. 
    \item Adjust the flow rate of nitrogen at 500 ml/min. 
    \item Open sampling bags' manual valves (not to be confused with the SMC valves which are still all closed).
    \item Turn on valve 1. Fill sampling bag number 1 for 2 minutes. Turn off valve 1. Repeat it for the seven sampling bags left.  
    \item Change the valve seen in Figure \ref{fig:nitrogen-vacuum-valve} to vacuum position and empty the bags.
    \item Flush the tubes after all the sampling bags have been emptied. This is to remove as much air as possible that could be left inside the sampling bags.
    \item Repeat the flushing for two more times. 
    \item Change the nitrogen bottle for the dry gas bottle. 
    \item Flush the tubes with nitrogen. 
    \item Fill the eight sampling bags one by one. 
    \item Take the sampling bags outside as shown in Figure \ref{fig:bags-outside} to simulate the conditions at which they will be exposed after landing. 
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

After each of the mentioned times, 6, 14, 24 and 48 hours, two sampling bags were taken inside the laboratory to be analyzed. The procedure to analyze was: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Have the dry gas flowing through the Picarro analyzer for at least one hour before the analysis. This is to avoid having moisture inside the tubes and have stable measurements of concentrations.
    \item Flush the tubes in between the two sampling bags with dry gas. For that the dry gas has to be disconnected from the analyzer and moisture would get into the Picarro. To avoid this, calibrating gas is flowing through the analyzer while the tubes are being flushed.
    \item Connect the system formed by two sampling bags with one end to the dry gas bottle and the other to the Picarro inlet.
    \item Wait for one hour until the readings of dry gas concentrations are stable. 
    \item Open the valve of the first sampling bag. 
    \item Right after the first sampling bag is empty, close its valve and open the valve for the next one. 
    \item Keep the dry gas flowing for one more hour after analysis. 
\end{itemize}

After analyzing the sampling bags the obtained results are presented in Figure \ref{fig:test17-results}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}


It should be mentioned that the results were not at all what was expected. If the sampling bags held the gases for 48 hours, the analyzed concentration should have been the same as the dry gas used to fill them or the variation should have been smaller. 

A possible explanation for this results could be that the emptying of the sampling bags was not done rigorously enough and that some air/nitrogen was left inside which diluted in the dry gas and changed the concentrations. This effect is even increased due to the smaller size of the used sampling bags (1 L instead of 3 L). This would also explain why the results don't follow any pattern. 

The general outcome of this test \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend that the team \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{has }\DIFdelend realized that the flushing of the sampling bags is a very delicate process. This test \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will be repeated but using the set-up described in Section 4. This test has also been }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was also }\DIFaddend useful to decide that the flushing of the sampling bags should be done with dry gas instead of nitrogen in order to minimize the effects of the nitrogen diluting in the samples. 

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This test had to and was repeated, using the set-up described in Section 4, with some differences. This time 3L bags were flushed with dry gas and left outside for 15, 24, 48 hours. After the flushing was done, two bags for each time were filled with 0.5 L and 1L of dry gas and left outside. Then they were analyzed and checked if the sample concentrations were the same or close enough with the reference values of the filled dry gas.
}

\DIFadd{The obtained results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:test17-resultsSEP}. The blue points represent the sampling bags with the 0.5L sample, while the red points show the sampling bags with the 1L sample. Sampling Bag No1 with the sampling bag No4 were analyzed after 15 hours. The pair of sampling bags No2 and No5 were analyzed after 24 hours and the last pair of sampling bags, No4 and No6 after 48 hours.

If water goes through the walls of the bags at the same rate for both bags then it is normal that sampling bags with larger amounts of sampled air have lower humidity concentrations. Therefore, for better results, the air left in the sampling bags at sea level pressure must be the maximum possible.

\subsubsection{Test 4: Low Pressure}

\textbf{\DIFadd{Styrofoam}}
\DIFaddend 

The same vacuum chamber was used as in Tests 18 and 29. The Styrofoam was measured on each side before it was placed in the chamber. It was then taken down to 5 hPa and held there for 75 minutes. It was then removed and the sides were measured again. It was found that there was no significant change in dimensions. The results can be seen in Table \ref{tab:styrofoam-test-result}.

As some sides are measured slightly bigger after and some slightly smaller it is thought this is due to the measuring technique and not due to changes in the Styrofoam. It is thought the result from side A could be due to deforming the Styrofoam with calipers or a misread original length.

\DIFadd{Sampling will take place between 200 hPa and 22 hPa, this area is seen in greater detail in Figure \ref{fig:airflowvacuumregion}. From this graph it can be seen that the airflow rate is varying from 1.2 LPM to 0.1 LPM.

\DIFadd{It was noted that the airflow rate seemed to be very low when compared to the rate at which the bag was inflating. For example for the first sampling point the flow rate was around 0.4 LPM and was filled for 44 seconds. This would imply that the bag was 10\% full with 0.3 L, however from visual inspection it was clear the bag was at least 75\% full. When the bag was brought back to sea level pressure the amount of remaining air in the bag was inspected. It appeared there was approximately 0.3 L left in the bag, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:remainingair}. This led to the conclusion that the airflow rate displayed is the equivalent airflow at sea level.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The vacuum chamber was then taken down to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \textbf{\DIFadd{Software}}

\DIFadd{With the same set-up as the airflow low pressure testing the software was tested to verify if it was operating as intended and that the conditions for stopping sampling were working.
}

\DIFadd{First the software was run as it will be during flight. As the pressure inside the chamber was dropped it was possible to see through the LEDs on board the PCB the system going through the flight actions. When the first sampling altitude was reached the lights came on for the flushing valve and pump indicating the system was flushing. After one minute these lights went out and the first valve opened. For the first sampling point it was possible to see the bag inflate providing extra visual confirmation that the system is operating as intended. 
}

\DIFadd{The next check was to see if our conditions for stopping sampling were working. Testing with the initial sampling schedule meant that the time  stopper always occurred first and worked well. The pressure threshold stopper also worked well with the system stopping sampling if the defined pressure range was left. Our third stopper is based on pressure and compares the pressure inside the bag to the ambient pressure to ensure we do not overpressure the bags. Interestingly it was found that this pressure was not being reached even after filling the bags continuously for three minutes, three times our time limit. 
}

\DIFadd{This shows that the maximum allowed pressure for the bags is not the pressure when the bag is 3L full but when the air in the bag has been compressed. This reduces the risk of bags bursting significantly.
}


\textbf{\DIFadd{Temperatures}}

\DIFadd{As it is not possible to complete a thermal vacuum test in addition to the thermal testing  temperatures were also monitored inside the vacuum chamber. Particular attention was paid to the CAC valve which will be on for the entire flight. From Figure \ref{fig:CACvalvetemp} it can be seen that after 2 hours the temperature is leveling off at around 68\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

However this is close to the melting point of the Styrofoam which is at 75\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$\degree{C}$

so care must be taken to ensure there is no contact between the valve and Styrofoam. In the actual flight the valve is expected to be cooler than this due to the ambient temperature being lower.

\DIFadd{The temperature of the pressure sensor, PCB, Pump and Manifold was also monitored with continuous use. After one hour and 48 minutes during the same test as the valve temperature the pressure sensor was found to reach 39\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Test 24: Software and Electronics Integration}}
\DIFadd{The different type of sensors were integrated one at time with the Arduino. The airflow sensor was first sensor to be integrated. The only problem with this sensor was the lack of calibration to give the correct data. Whilst at FMI this sensor was calibrated using another airflow sensor at FMI. The next sensor to be integrated was the temperature sensor. After several failed attempts to establish a connection to the sensor, a library, based on the information from the sensors datasheet was made. With this library communication was successfully established. During testing some problems were discovered with the temperature sensors as they stopped giving data back when exposed to colder temperatures. This was fixed by implementing a new piece of software code. Before the integration of the pressure sensor it had been expected the need of a self made library, despite this several changes was needed to the library to make the sensor responsive. }\par
\DIFadd{It was discovered that the pressure sensor on board the PCB wouldn't function while the other pressure sensors when connected to the SPI bus. Parasitic capacitance was suggested to be the culprit when looking on the SPI bus with an oscilloscope. During an telephone conference with our mentors another more reasonable theory was put forwards. Since the SPI was designed to function for short distances only the long cables connecting the outside pressure sensors caused reflections in the bus. The solution was to disregard the pressure sensor on the PCB since it was not a critical sensor.}\par
\DIFadd{When all the sensors had been integrated the sensors where tested together. The result was all the sensors, exept the PCB pressure sensor, working without interfering with each other.

\DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{\DIFadd{Test results for Electrical component testing}}
\label{sec:Test-Results-Electrical-Component-Testing}
\begin{itemize}
\item \DIFadd{Test 1: The max output from the airflow sensor was not 10V as advertised, it was instead 10.82V.  The resistors in the voltage divider will be changed accordingly to take care of this problem and not to damage the Arduino. There will be 240k Ohms on the upper part of the voltage divider and 100k on the bottom. This will limit the max output to approximately 3.2V which will be safe for the Arduino. Pressure sensor max output was approximately 9.54V at ground level. The sensor is sensitive to the voltage divider. It seems that a larger resistance lowers the output compared to an open circuit. After testing with three resistors at 330k, 100k, 33k and 3.3k Ohm resistor it was seen that using 330k Ohm the output was measured to 7V over the whole bridge. With the 3.3k Ohm voltage divider the output was measured to be 9.52V which is 0.2\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

below open circuit which is smaller than the measurement error of the sensor itself. Furthermore the output had a lot of very small spikes which gave a voltage ripple of 300-400mV, adding a 0.47uF capacitance in parallel to the output and ground decreased the ripple to 60-70mV. Larger capacitors did not lower the ripple although smaller capacitors increased the ripple. Furthermore the start up spikes of the senor has to be rectified, therefore a 1uF capacitor will be added to the sensor output on the wiring since there is no space dedicated for this on the main PCB. Furthermore, huge spikes of upwards to 30V peak to peak was discovered on turn on on the Vin on the pressure sensor. Therefore a 100uF electrolytic capacitor will be added in parallel to the 12 system
}\item \DIFadd{Test 2: Using the MOSFET as a grounding switch and supplying 3.2V to the gate the resulting drain to source voltage was below 0.3V for components using 24V or 28V
}\item \DIFadd{Test 3: 1k Ohm on 12V  3.9k Ohm for 24V as pull-up resistors
}\item \DIFadd{Test 4: The circuit worked as expected. The circuit pulled 127mA at 24V 3.048W for one manifold valve. The valves on the tubing gave the same results
}\item \DIFadd{Test 5: Supplying 3.2V to the gate on the MOSFET started the pump as expected.
}\item \DIFadd{Test 6: The circuit functioned as expected. The indications are indicating each DCDC individually
}\item \DIFadd{Test 7: All interface connections have been checked with good result by using the continuity measurement on a multimeter
}\item \DIFadd{Test 8: Trimming works, extra resistors had to be added in series with the potentiometer to get the resistance required for the voltage output that was required. 26+390k Ohm for 24V. 15 + 32k Ohm for 12V
}\item \DIFadd{Test 9: The proposed way of grounding analog sensors works. Although, if there is a faulty grounding somewhere else, the Arduino sits at risk since all the grounding current goes through the Arduino and might burn the Arduino
}\item \DIFadd{Test 10: Using the heaters in parallel at 28.8V worked fine as long as they had some material to dissipate the heat into. Otherwise they are overheating. This is true at 28V as well which is the specified max voltage. Supplying 28.8V will not be a problem. The heaters did use a little extra power. The specific power draws were: 28.62V and depending on the temperature the power draw was 0.37-0.36A. This results in a power draw of 10.59W which is 0.59W or 5.9\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

more than expected.

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Test Results for PCB Testing}}
\label{sec:Test-Results-PCB-Testing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \DIFadd{Test 12: All connections were checked and it was discovered that some connections were not connected and some were faulty connected. There was one MOSFET gate pin that was not connected. The 28.8V power that goes to the heaters was connected to the 24V power. And the 24V power was not connected to the dc-dc. This was solved by adding a separate wire to connect the 24V power to one of the pins 24V pins on the D-Subs, since the D-Subs were connected together. The 28.8V power was solved by removing the cable from the d-sub and adding a separate connector that goes to 28.8V power. The MOSFET gate problem was solved by adding a wire from the correct Arduino pin to the corresponding MOSFET gate pin.
    }\item \DIFadd{Test 13: After the connections was checked and the problems resolved, the board was turned on. The functionality was checked and everything worked nominally.
}\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Test 27: Shock test}}
\DIFadd{The entire pneumatic system and electrical system was mounted in the AAC box along with the walls and styrofoam attached. It was then dropped from a height of approximately one meter three times. Nothing came loose or was damaged after this drop test. All electronics were verified to still work.
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Test 9: Vibration test}}
\DIFadd{The entire experiment was placed in the tailgate of a car, while the test was carried out on a 18 km long rough terrain. An emergency brake was also implemented during the test. The experiment's functionality and structural integrity were capable of handling the vibrations and the stopping force.
No damages or issues were detected after this test. 
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Test 25: Structure test}}
\DIFadd{A team member was placed on top of each box's structure, see Figure \ref{fig:structure-test}. Both the CAC and AAC box was able to fully support the member's weight without showing any instability or deflections. No damages or issues were detected after this test.

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Test 12: Removal test}}
\DIFadd{For a non team member to perform the removal of the CAC box based on the given instructions, it took that person 6 min and 25 sec. One problem that occurred during this test was that the person had problems to distinguishing the CAC from the AAC box. To resolve this the boxes will now have clear labels on them. The set up for this test can be seen in Figure \ref{}.

\end{figure}

\DIFadd{There were additional confusions during the test due to the fact the experiment was not actually fixed to the gondola and it had to be explained what was meant by gondola attachment points. The items to be unscrewed were also not yet clearly marked which also added time to the test. It is expected that the time will be lower for the recovery team due to this. Therefore the team finds this time to be satisfactory.
}


\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Test 2: Data collection test}}
\DIFadd{The full software was run in auto mode to check everything operated as expected over a full test flight. At the end of the simulated flight the experiment was to shutdown automatically. This was tested both on the bench and in the vacuum chamber. In the vacuum chamber tests, see Section \ref{lowpressure}, the bench test, see Appendix \ref{benchtest} and the thermal test, see Appendix \ref{thermaltestresults} data collection was also monitored. It was found that the physical samples were being collected properly and all the sensors were returning good data.
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Test 7: Bench test}}\label{benchtest}
\DIFadd{The experiment was run for 5 hours simulating 1 hour on ground, 1.5 hours in ascent, 2 hours in float and 0.5 hours in descent. The experiment was found to be operating as intended at all points. Additionally, the temperature sensors have been tested at ambient conditions for over 6 hours. No problems were found with the temperature sensors on the bench.
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Test 16: Sampling test}}
\DIFadd{The system was tested while already mounted as this test was pushed back due to the late arrival of the static pressure sensor.
}

\DIFadd{The Arduino successfully controlled all valves and the pump and through the static pressure and airflow sensor readings alone it could be confirmed if a bag was sampling.
