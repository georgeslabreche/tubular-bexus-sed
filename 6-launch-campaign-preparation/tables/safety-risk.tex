Flammable substances    & Styrofoam Brand Foam is oil based and is highly flammable & Extensive testing will be performed to make sure there is no heat/fire source \\ \hline
Sharp or cutting edges & Edges along the experiment                                & File down edges                                                               \\ \hline
Chemical substances & Chemicals could be exposed after a hard landing & Magnesium Perchlorate filter mechanism is sealed and has been used before without any problem. In case of exposure after a hard impact, use protective goggles and gloves to avoid contact with the eyes and skin. The small quantities used for the experiment will not be a threat for the environment. Magnesium Perchlorate alone is not flammable but may cause or intensify fire in case of contact with combustible material. Therefore, the filter is made of stainless steel, which has high durability.       \\ \hline
