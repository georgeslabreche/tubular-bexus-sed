\subsection{Post Flight Activities}

To ensure minimize the length of time in which mixing of the gas occurs in the collected CAC samples, is necessary that the they  be analyzed as soon as possible after the experiment landing. Measurements will be made in partnership with the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) thus it is necessary that the experiment can be transported to the measurement equipment provided by FMI. To make measurements at the landing site would be unfeasible due to the size of the gas analyzer hence measurements are to be made at the Esrange Space Centre.

The FMI team would begin their travel to Esrange as soon as the balloon landing site has been located. Once the experiment has been recovered to Esrange the samples will be analyzed by the FMI equipment and the preliminary results will be found. The disadvantages of this option are that additional time in between the gas collection and the analysis means a loss of vertical resolution in the sample and the transportation of the equipment from Sodankyl√§ to Esrange may result in calibration loss due to equipment vibrations caused by transportation. The ideal scenario for would be to have the FMI team be at Esrange the day before the launch despite the possibility of waiting time in case of short notice launch cancellations. This would give margins to react to unforeseen problems such as trouble on the road due to bad weather as well as missing equipment and/or tools. Furthermore, this would allow additional time to install and calibrate their lab equipment at Esrange prior to the launch.

Special consideration will be put into designing the experiment so that the recovery team can easily remove the experiment from its enclosure for possible transportation back to Esrange via helicopter. Detailed instructions will be provided on operating the detachable mechanism that will be designed. In addition, instructions will be provided to ensure that the system is completely shut down and the valves secured. Shutdown will be automated however a manual shutdown mechanism will be included should the automation fail.

The analysis results that will then be used for the post flight meeting. Further analysis will then be carried out to fully understand the data. Once a full analysis of the data has been completed there is the potential for publication of research findings.
