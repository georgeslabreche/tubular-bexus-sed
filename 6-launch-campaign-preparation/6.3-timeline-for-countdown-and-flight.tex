\subsection{Timeline for Countdown and Flight}
Table \ref{tab:countflight} is the estimated timeline during countdown and flight. 

The desired altitudes in which air samples are to be collected with the sampling bags are associated with specific air pressure values. Thus, the valve operations to sample air during the balloon Ascent and Descent Phases are to be triggered by readings from the ambient pressure sensor. The time values presented in Table \ref{tab:countflight} merely serve as an indicative estimate of when the sampling will take place as sampling will not be programmed based on flight time.
