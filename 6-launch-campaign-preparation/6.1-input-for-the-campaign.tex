\subsection{Input for the Campaign / Flight Requirements Plans}

The TUBULAR experiment consisted of two boxes with one air sampling system inside each of them. It was positioned with at least one side exposed to the outside.

\subsubsection{Dimensions and Mass}
\label{sec:dim-mass}

The data shown in Table \ref{tab:dim-mass-tab} below was based on the design presented in Section \ref{Mechanical_Design}.

\subsubsection{Safety Risks}
Table \ref{tab:safrisk} contains the risks of all stages of the whole campaign and project.

\subsubsection{Electrical Interfaces}

Please refer to Table \ref{tab:electrical-interface-table} for details on the electrical interfaces with the gondola.

\subsubsection{Launch Site Requirements}
The experiment needed some preparations before the flight. For that reason, the team needed a room with a big table to place the Picarro analyzer, with some extra space for all the interfaces between the analyzer and the CAC system, as well as the AAC system.
A laptop PC was used to monitor the experiment. Therefore, a desk and a chair were needed for this station. A total of 16 chairs need to be rented: 13 chairs for all members of the TUBULAR Team and an additional three for visiting collaborators from FMI. One power outlet and one Ethernet cable for E-link connection were also essential for the laptop PC.

\subsubsection{Flight Requirements}

Floating altitude was desired to be as high as possible in order to sample air from the stratosphere both in ascent and Decent Phase. The duration of the Float Phase was not relevant for the experiment performance. 

\smallskip
No conditions for visibility were required for this experiment.

\smallskip
With respect to a swift recovery and transport for fast data analysis, a launch time in the early morning hours was favorable.

\subsubsection{Accommodation Requirements}

The experiment involved two rectangular boxes inside the gondola environment. The only requirement was to allocate the box with at least one face exposed to the outside. The latter also facilitated the fast experiment recovery for the later analysis of the collected samples. The design allowed full adaptability regarding the interface with the gondola's rails, for more details see Section \ref{Mechanical_Design}. The current location of the experiment in Figure \ref{goldola_accommodation} is the one arranged with REXUS/BEXUS Coordinators during the Training Week in Esrange.
