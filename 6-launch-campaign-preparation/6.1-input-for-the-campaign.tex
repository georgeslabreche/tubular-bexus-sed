\subsection{Input for the Campaign / Flight Requirements Plans}

The TUBULAR experiment consists of one box with two air sampling systems inside. It shall be positioned with at least one side exposed to the outside.

\subsubsection{Dimensions and Mass}

The data shown in Table \ref{tab:dim-mass-tab} below is based on the design presented in Section \ref{Mechanical_Design}. %The mass for the electronics is estimated to be 1.5 kg.

\subsubsection{Safety Risks}
Table \ref{tab:safrisk} contains the risks of all stages of the whole campaign and project.

\subsubsection{Electrical Interfaces}

Please refer to Table \ref{tab:electrical-interface-table} for details on the electrical interfaces with the gondola.

\subsubsection{Launch Site Requirements}
The experiment needs some preparations before the flight. For that reason, the team will need a room with a big table to place the Picarro analyzer, with some extra space for all the interfaces between the analyzer and the CAC system, as well as the AAC system.
A laptop PC will be used to monitor the experiment. Therefore, a desk and a chair are needed for this station. A total of 16 chairs need to be rented: 13 chairs for all members of the TUBULAR Team and an additional three for visiting collaborators from FMI. One power outlet and one Ethernet cable for E-link connection are also essential for the laptop PC.

\subsubsection{Flight Requirements}

Floating altitude is desired to be as high as possible in order to sample air from the stratosphere both in ascent and Decent Phase. The duration of the Float Phase is not relevant for the experiment performance. 

\smallskip
No conditions for visibility are required for this experiment.

\smallskip
With respect to a swift recovery and transport for fast data analysis, a launch time in the early morning hours would be favorable.

\subsubsection{Accommodation Requirements}

The experiment involves two rectangular boxes inside the gondola environment. The only requirement is to allocate the box with at least one face exposed to the outside. The latter will also facilitate the fast experiment recovery for the later analysis of the collected samples. The design allows full adaptability regarding the interface with the gondola's rails, for more details see Section \ref{Mechanical_Design}. The current location of the experiment in Figure \ref{goldola_accommodation} is the one arranged with REXUS/BEXUS Coordinators during the Training Week in Esrange.
