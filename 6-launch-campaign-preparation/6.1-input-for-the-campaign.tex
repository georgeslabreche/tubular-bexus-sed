\subsection{Input for the Campaign / Flight Requirements Plans}

The TUBULAR experiment consists of one box with two air sampling systems inside. It shall be positioned with at least one side exposed to the outside.

\subsubsection{Dimensions and Mass}

The data shown in Table \ref{dimensions_mass} below is based on the design presented in section \ref{Mechanical_Design}. The centered position of the CoG is restricted by the CAC coiled tube location, which is the element with the highest mass. The mass for the electronics is estimated to be 1.5 kg.

\subsubsection{Safety Risks}
Table \ref{tab:safrisk} contains the risks of all stages of the whole campaign and project.

\subsubsection{Electrical Interfaces}

Please refer to Table \ref{tab:electrical-interface-table} for details on the electrical interfaces with the gondola.

\subsubsection{Launch Site Requirements}
A laptop PC will be used to monitor the experiment. Therefore, a desk and a chair are needed. It will be better, if there are several chairs for the team members. One power outlet and one Ethernet cable for E-link connection are also essential for the laptop PC.

\subsubsection{Flight Requirements}

Floating altitude is desired to be as high as possible in order to sample air from the stratosphere both in ascent and decent phase. The duration of the float phase is not relevant for the experiment performance. 

\smallskip
No conditions for visibility are required for this experiment.

\smallskip
The experiment has no requirements regarding time of launch nor daylight or lack of it.

\subsubsection{Accommodation Requirements}

The experiment involves one cubic box inside the gondola environment. The only requirement is to allocate the box with at least one face exposed to the outside. The latter will also facilitate the fast experiment recovery for the later analysis of the collected samples. The design allows full adaptability regarding the interface with the gondola's rails, for more detail see section \ref{Mechanical_Design}.
