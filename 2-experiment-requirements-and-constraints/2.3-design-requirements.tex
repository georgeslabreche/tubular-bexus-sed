\subsection{Design Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[label=D.\arabic*]
    \item The experiment \textit{shall} operate in the temperature profile of the BEXUS vehicle flight and launch.
    \item The experiment \textit{shall} operate in the vibration profile of the BEXUS vehicle flight and launch.
    \item The experiment \textit{shall} not disturb or harm the launch vehicle.
    \item The experiment's communication system \textit{shall} be compatible with the gondola's E-link system.
    \item The experiment's power supply \textit{shall} be compatible with the gondola's provided power.
    \item The experiment \textit{shall} not disturb other experiments on the gondola.
    \item The total DC current draw \textit{should} be below 1.8 A.
    \item The total power consumption \textit{should} be below 374 Wh.
    \item The experiment \textit{shall} be able to operate in low pressure conditions (300 mbar) up to 30 km altitude.
    \item The components of the experiment \textit{shall} operate within their temperature ranges.
    \item The OBC \textit{shall} be able to autonomously control the heaters.
    \item The ground station GC \textit{shall} be able to display some of the received data.
    \item The experiment \textit{shall} be able to survive and operate between -30\degree C and 60\degree C.
    \item The external components that are directly exposed to the outside environment \textit{shall} be able to operate at -70\degree C.
    \item The watchdog \textit{should} be able to reset the system.
    \item The experiment \textit{shall} be able to autonomously turn itself off just before landing.
    \item The experiment box \textit{shall} be placed with at least one face exposed to the outside.
