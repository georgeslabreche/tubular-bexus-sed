\subsection{Design Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[D.1] The experiment \textit{shall} operate in the temperature profile of the BEXUS flight\cite{BexusManual}.
    \item[D.2] The experiment \textit{shall} operate in the vibration profile of the BEXUS flight\cite{BexusManual}.
    \item[D.3] The experiment \textit{shall} not have sharp edges or loose connections to the gondola that can harm the launch vehicle, other experiments, and people.%\textsuperscript{\ref{fn:unnecessary-requirement}}
    \item[D.4] The experiment's communication system \textit{shall} be compatible with the gondola's E-link system with the RJF21B connector over UDP for down-link and TCP for up-link.
    \item[D.5] The experiment's power supply \textit{shall} have a 24v, 12v, 5v and 3.3v power output and be able to take 28.8v input through the Amphenol PT02E8-4P connector supplied from the gondola. 
    \item[D.7] For the supplied voltage of 28.8 V, the total continuous DC current draw \textit{should} be below 1.8 A.
    \item[D.8] The total power consumption \textit{should} be below 374 Wh.
    \item[D.16] The experiment \textit{shall} be able to autonomously turn itself off just before landing.
    \item[D.17] The experiment box \textit{shall} be placed with at least one face exposed to the outside.
    \item[D.18] The experiment \textit{shall} operate in the pressure profile of the BEXUS flight\cite{BexusManual}.
    \item[D.19] The experiment \textit{shall} operate in the vertical and horizontal accelerations profile of the BEXUS flight\cite{BexusManual}.

    \item[D.24] The temperature of the Brain\footnote{The Brain is a central command unit which contains Electronic Box and pneumatic sampling system.} \textit{shall} be between -10$\degree$C and 25$\degree$C.
    \item[D.26] The air sampling systems \textit{shall} filter out all water molecules before filling the sampling bags.
    \item[D.27] The total weight of the experiment \textit{shall} be less than 28 kg.
    \item[D.28] The AAC box \textit{shall} be able to fit at least $6$ air sampling bags.
    \item[D.29] The CAC box \textit{shall} take less than 3 minutes to be removed from the gondola without removing the whole experiment.
    \item[D.30] The AAC \textit{shall} be re-usable for future balloon flights.
    \item[D.31] The altitude from which a sampling bag will start sampling \textit{shall} be programmable.
    \item[D.32] The altitude from which a sampling bag will stop sampling \textit{shall} be programmable.
