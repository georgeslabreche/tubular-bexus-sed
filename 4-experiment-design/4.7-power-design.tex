\subsubsection{Power System Requirements}
\begin{centering}
The Gondola provides 28.8 V or 13 Ah battery with a recommended maximum current draw of 1.8A \cite{BexusManual}. The experiment must run on external power from 4 hours before launch during the countdown phase and for the entire flight duration, lasting approximately 4 hours. As a factor of safety the experiment should be able to run for an additional 2 hours.

\subsubsection{Power System Control and Regulation}
The power on board will be split using three DC-DC converters. The pump and valves both have a high peak current. Therefore it was decided to use two DC-DC converters to step down from 28.8V to 24V giving the pump its own dedicated DC-DC converter. This is as the pump and valves both have a high peak current draw. The Arduino will also have its own DC-DC converter stepping the voltage down from 28.8V to 12V. It is thought using three DC-DC converters will provide the best compromise between efficiency, cost and heating.
