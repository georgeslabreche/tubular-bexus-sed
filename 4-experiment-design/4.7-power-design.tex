\subsubsection{Power System Requirements}
\begin{centering}
The Gondola provides a 28.8 V, 374 Wh or 13 Ah battery with a recommended maximum continuous current draw of 1.8 A . However, more typical values are 196 Wh or 7 Ah \cite{BexusManual}.The experiment must run on (gondola) battery for two hours before launch during the countdown phase and for the entire flight duration, lasting approximately six hours. As a factor of safety, in case of unexpected delays, the experiment should be able to run for an additional two hours. Therefore the experiment must be able to run on (gondala) power for a total of 10 hours. For this reason, all the calculations have been done using a 10 hour total time\cite{BexusManual}.

The estimated total power consumption 181 Wh, Table \ref{tab:power-design-table}, is within the limits of the available power. Other calculations for the average, peak, and minimum power values are 24 W, 38 W, and 16 W respectively. In addition the different expected current consumption for the average, peak, and minimum values are 0.64 A, 1.1 A, and 0.22 A respectively.

The 24 V DC-DC converters have 2.5 A output current and 60 W output power with the efficiency of 93\%. This fulfills the peak requirements for both power and current. Moreover, the dissipated power and current across the DC-DCs are calculated as 12.69 Wh and 45 mA respectively and have been added to the total power budget.
