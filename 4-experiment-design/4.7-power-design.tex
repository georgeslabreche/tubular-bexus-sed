\subsection{Power Design}

\begin{centering}
The Gondola provides 28.8 V/1 mA or 13 Ah battery with a recommended maximum current draw of 1.8A \cite{BexusManual}. The experiment must run on external power from 4 hours before launch during the countdown phase and for the entire flight duration, lasting approximately 4 hours. As a factor of safety the experiment should be able to run for an additional 2 hours.
