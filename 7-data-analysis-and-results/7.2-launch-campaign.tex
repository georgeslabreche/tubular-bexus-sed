\subsection{Launch Campaign}
\subsubsection{Flight preparation activities during launch campaign} %.... maybe some of this is currently in chapter 6
The flight preparations can be found in Section \ref{prep_for_Esrange}.

\subsubsection{Flight performance}
It is expected to receive a downlink from the gondola. All data received will be stored in the ground station computer. The estimated data across the E-link will be $7.128$ MB, while the stored data onboard SD card is estimated to be $6.552$ MB.

\subsubsection{Recovery}
If our request for quick helicopter recovery of the CAC is granted, the retrieval team will be provided a checklist, in Section \ref{sec:recovery-checklist}, so they can pull out the CAC from the gondola while the AAC will be brought back with the rest of the gondola.

\subsubsection{Post flight activities}
Once the gondola has been brought back, the samples collected by the CAC and AAC will be analyzed.
