\subsection{Lessons Learned}
At this early stage of the experiment, and having already submitted an accepted experimental proposal, the TUBULAR team has learned important lessons regarding document creation as well as learning how to build an idea into a project. \par
The TUBULAR team expects that the BEXUS programme will be rewarding in terms of experience regarding balloon craft design and development, with real deadlines, published documents, and team work. This part of the document will be updated in later SEDs to reflect what the team members have learned.

\subsubsection{Science}
After an extended research in trace gases and climate change, as well as in atmospheric sampling methods, the science team has gained so far: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item General knowledge in climate change.
    \item General knowledge in the different sampling methods of the atmosphere; its characteristics and applications.
    \item Study scientific papers in detail.
    \item Outreach to scientific community.
    \item Translating scientific concepts to technical teams.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Electrical Division}
The electrical team has thus far enhanced its understanding of the electronics design as well as gained confidence in selecting appropriate components as per requirements. Some of the points team improved as their general understanding are listed below:  
\begin{itemize}

    \item Gained confidence in designing electronics circuitry.
    \item Familiarized with the selection of the electrical components. 
    \item By reading through large number of data sheets, team is now able to easily extract and understand technical details. 
    \item Learned and developed power calculation skills.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Software Division}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Learned more about version control in the form of Git.
    \item Learned how to implement RTOS in an Arduino micro-controller.
    \item Learned how to translate experiment requirements to software design.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Mechanical Division}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Come up with real design solutions starting from conceptual problems.
    \item Make a proper use of both space and mass.
    \item Learn mechanical \textit{tricks} when designing. 
    
    % \item Choose components depending of availability and required characteristics.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Management Division}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Coordination between multiple project stakeholders.
    \item Task definition, estimation, and management.
    \item Task integration.
    \item Conflict management and resolution.
    \item Communication flows.
    \item Funding research and outreach.
\end{itemize}
