\subsection{Lessons Learned}
At the end of the project, the TUBULAR Team has learned many important lessons regarding document creation as well as learning how to build an idea into a project, integrating it, testing it, flying it and analysisng the data afterwards. \par
The TUBULAR Team found that the REXUS/BEXUS programme was rewarding in terms of experience regarding balloon craft design and development, with real deadlines, published documents, and team work. 

\subsubsection{Management Division}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Coordination between multiple project stakeholders.
    \item Task definition, estimation, and management.
    \item Task integration.
    \item Conflict management and resolution.
    \item Communication flows.
    \item Funding research and outreach.
    \item Identifying team member strengths as well as weaknesses and assigning responsibilities accordingly without neglecting the opportunities to improve on weaknesses. 
    \item Do not assume cross-division communication will take place without organizing/planning it.
    \item Reviewing progress of assigned task should be continuous rather than waiting for their due dates.
    \item Agree on and clearly communicate to the team definition of \enquote{Done} when referring to tasks being completed.
    \item Agree on and clearly communicate to the team the definition of \enquote{Final Version} when referring to schematics, diagrams, and component lists.
    \item The lessons learned section of previous BEXUS SEDs is an invaluable resource that answers many BEXUS related recurring questions.
    \item If changes in management are required it is important that there is a sufficiently long change over period to allow a transfer of knowledge.
    \item Tasks that are not completed on time or were simply not worked on during the assigned time will impact projected deadlines and these situations must be planned for and mitigated against. An early red flag for this is if the reported team working hours tend to be lower than expected at which point one can expect to have to make up those hours up before a deadline. These concerns must continuously be communicated to the team.
    \item The REXUS/BEXUS programme is a significant investment in time and resources from all programme partners and as such the unique opportunity is not limited to participating students but to component manufacturers and suppliers as well. With this in mind, the team should not shy away from aggressively seeking funds or sponsorships from component manufacturers and suppliers as they stand to benefit from such a partnership to show case the robustness of their products.
    \item Testing will always take longer than expected and so time must be planned to account for this.
    \item When working with many remote team members extra time must be allowed for tasks to be completed as the communication is slower. Internal earlier deadlines help a lot.
    \item During manufacture and test having many smaller deadlines has proven useful in ensuring things stick to the time plan.
    \item When things don't go to plan during flight it is essential to keep a cool head and think things through calmly. It might be hard to make final decisions on things but it is important to ensure appropriate actions are taken in a timely and sensible fashion.
    \item You can never do too much testing!
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Scientific Division}
After an extended research in trace gases and climate change, as well as in atmospheric sampling methods, the science team has gained so far: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item General knowledge in climate change.
    \item General knowledge in the different sampling methods of the atmosphere; its characteristics and applications.

    \item How to sufficiently distribute the tasks within the science team and keep good communication with the other departments. 
    \item Experience, that writing down the tasks that need to be done, and keep tracking on them is better rather than having them as goals.
    \item Experience in producing a presentation only with the key points of a project and presenting it in front of other people.
    \item Work as a group from different locations.
    \item How to prepare and plan a test, under the real environment of the experiment. 
    \item The importance of testing, and how to sufficiently deal with problems that come up unexpectedly.
    \item How to perform a failure analysis, documenting every step.
    \item Knowledge in data analysis procedure and how to extract the desired results from raw data.
    \item Using MATLAB to obtain the vertical profiles of the CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and CO gasses. 
     
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Electrical Division}
The electrical team has enhanced its understanding of the electronics design as well as gained confidence in selecting appropriate components as per requirements. Some of the points team improved as their general understanding are listed below:  
\begin{itemize}

    \item Gained confidence in designing electronics circuitry.
    \item Familiarized with the selection of the electrical components. 
    \item By reading through large number of data sheets, team is now able to easily extract and understand technical details. 
    \item Learned and developed power calculation skills.
    \item Got experience of using the Eagle software and how to find and make the libraries, footprints, and schematics for the required components.
    \item How to test the components in the vacuum chamber.
    \item Learned about the different connectors, wires and how to place the components on the PCB so the actual design can fit into the experiment box.
    \item Discovered the cascading consequences of changing one component.
    \item Finding how having big sheets with a lot of information can be preferable to several sheets with less specification.
    \item While designing PCB's with Eagle it's a good idea to draw the traces manually rather than using autotracer. Since it allows you double check your schematics while pulling the traces.
    \item When using netnaming to design schematics for later PCB designs in Eagle it's very important to triple check the net names since they sometimes change in unexpected ways.
    \item Got practical experience of soldering the different types of sensors, wires and connectors. 
    \item Learned how to solder SMD miniature pressure sensors onto the PCB.
    \item Familiarized with using work shop tools and machinery.
    \item Got experience how to work around spontaneous problems arise due to design changes by the other departments and the testings. 
    \item Learned how to conduct failure analysis; it's basic methodology and rules required in order to avoid destruction of any evidence for the post-flight analysis. 
    \item Learned how important electrical housekeeping data could be during a in-flight errors.
    \item Learned how to come up with and assess compromises during launch campaign to accommodate to eventual changes.
