\subsection{Experiment Objectives}

Beyond providing knowledge on greenhouse gas distributions, the sampling obtained from the experiment will serve as a reference to validate the robustness and reliability of proposed sampling system through comparative analysis of results obtained with a reference sampling system.

The primary objective of the experiment consists of validating the proposed sampling system as a reliable mechanism that enables sampling of stratospheric greenhouse gases in remote areas.

The secondary objective of the experiment will be to analyze the samples by both systems in a manner that will contribute to climate change research in the Arctic region. The trace gas profiles to be analyzed are that of carbon dioxide (CO$_{2}$), methane (CH$_{4}$), and nitrous oxide (N$_{2}$O).
