\subsection{Experiment Concept}

The experiment seeks to test the viability and reliability of a proposed cost-effective alternative to the The AirCore Sampling System. The AirCore Sampling System consists of a long and thin stainless steel tube shaped in the form of a coil which takes advantage of changes in pressure during descent to sample the surrounding atmosphere and preserve a profile (see Figure \ref{fig:A1} in Appendix A). Sampling during a balloonâ€™s descent phase will result in a profile shape extending the knowledge of distribution of trace gases for the measured column between the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere \cite{Karion}. The proposed experiment will consist of two sampling subsystems: a conventional implementation of AirCore as described above, henceforth referred to as CAC, and a proposed alternative, henceforth referred to as Alternative AirCore (AAC).

The proposed AAC system is primarily motivated by the CAC sampling mechanism lacking flexibility in choice of coverage area due to the geographical restriction imposed by the irreversible process of gas mixing along the air column sampled in its stainless tube. Because of this, the sampling region for the CAC system needs to remain within proximity to research facilities for post-flight gas analysis. The AAC sampling system is a proposed alternative configuration to the CAC sampling system that has been designed to address this limitation all while improving cost-effectiveness. The AAC sampling system consists of a series of small independent air sampling bags (see Figure \ref{fig:A2} in Appendix A) rather than a single long tube as for the CAC. The air sampling bags will be opened and closed in series to ensure continuous sampling in which analysis can then be merged into a single profile. Each sampling bag is to be allocated a small vertical sampling size of 500 meters in which mixing of gases becomes a lesser concern.

The use of sampling bags in series rather than a single long tube is meant to tackle limitations of CAC by 1) reducing system implementation cost inherent to the production of a long tube and 2) enabling sampling of remote areas by reducing the effect of mixing of gases in post-analysis. Overall design of AAC will be approached with miniaturization, cost-effectiveness, and design for manufacturability (DFM) in mind with the purpose of enabling ease of replication.
