\subsection{Mission Statement}

There is little information on the distribution of trace gases at the stratosphere due to the inherent difficulty and high cost of air sampling above aircraft altitudes \cite{Trace}. The experiment seeks to contribute to and support climate change research by proposing and validating a low-cost air sampling mechanism that reduces the current complexities and limitations of obtaining data on stratospheric greenhouse gas distribution.
